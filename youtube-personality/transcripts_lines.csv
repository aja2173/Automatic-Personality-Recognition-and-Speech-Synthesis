"VLOG1","You know what I see - - no, more like hear a lot these days, is people calling other people gay as an insult. Now what makes people come up with calling others gay? Now here's an example. Hey, hey, you wanna trade Pokemon or Ziegfield cards? Or, or, or we can play, we can play superheroes. Oh, can I be Optimus Prime? Dude, you are so gay. Dude, the cool kids do crack. Oh, my mommy says, say no to drugs. Okay, how the hell does playing Pokemon cards or -- or --- or dancing or holding hands with another guy make me homosexual? I don't get these people.This is how it is in my school. Okay, here's an example. All right, um, when they see two guys are gay, they're together, they're like no, ew, no. No, no that -- that doesn't go together - - you know, two guys, no. two sticks, no. It just doesn't work like . But when they see two girls, they're like, get it on. And I don't get these people. I've never seen someone say like, oh, you're so homosexual or you're so lesbian or you're such a child molester. It is always the word gay, cause apparently gay is now an insult, even though the word means like happy and lively and that kinda giddy feeling you have inside, like -- -- but no you have to turn that happy word into a mean word. Apparently, we can do that now, turning good things into bad things. It's like how Spiderman felt good, but then that -- that -- that grease that gets all over him and then and then evil Dr. Octopus. That's so gay, you like Spiderman. Lar, I'm going to the movies with the guys to watch Mama Mia.You never know if other people are offended by what you say. I'm not saying you're a bad person if you do it. I used to do it all the time. I'm more focused on why we say it. In the end, we're all the same. You know, there's nothing wrong with it. I was just wondering where it all came from, you know. All right, thanks a lot for watching. Oh, yeah and the club channel is up and running. So, make sure to check that out because there's gonna be a lot of cool stuff on there. We'll do up to like four challenges at a time. We'll do contests, dares, questions.

"VLOG10","﻿Hey everybody, it's Monday, July twenty seventh, two thousand and nine and that means it's time for another edition of XXXX.Governor Palin's back in the news this week as she transitions from Alaska governor to Alaskan citizen. Pending all power to Lieutenant Governor Parnell, she had a few choice words for the Media.It is, as throughout all Alaska, that big wild, good wife teaming along the road that is north to the future. That's what we get to see every day. Now what the rest of America gets to see along with us, is in this last frontier there is hope and opportunity and there is country pride. And it is our man and women in uniform securing it. And we are facing tough challenges in America with some seeming to just be hell bent maybe on tearing down our nation, perpetuating some pessimism and suggesting American apologetics.What?And we can resist enslavement to big central government that pressures hope and opportunity. Be wary of accepting government largesse. It doesn't come free and often accepting it takes away everything that is free. Melting into Washington's powerful, caretaking arms will just suck incentive to work hard and charge our own course right out of us.Uh, wait. Is that -- no way, what? She made a good point there at the end. But sometimes I have to wonder if I'm listening to Sarah Palin or Nicholas Fain .In other news over the weekend I heard the story of Troy Anthony Davis. Do you know who he is? You should.Mister Davis was sentenced to death for the murder of an off duty Savannah, Georgia police officer named Mark McPhail back in nineteen ninety one. Davis was convicted solely on the testimony of nine eye witnesses. Since that time three eye witnesses have recanted, admitting that they were coerced and two other eye witnesses admitted that they never even saw the murder take place.Despite a wealth of information that has been presented to the court and some new evidence yet to be presented, Mister Davis remains on death row after eighteen years. For more information about Troy Anthony Davis and how you can help in his case, check out IAMTROY dot com.That's all I've got for this week for everybody. I hope you enjoyed the show because although I started recording on Monday, July twenty seventh, it's Tuesday, July twenty eighth and that time has come. Gotta get out of here for work, new work schedule, so until next time, keep checking out XXXX dot com for daily blog posts, updates and etcetera and meet me back here Monday for new video or XXXX. Thanks for watching.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG100","﻿Hi, what's up? Um, today I went to school and um, um, I was late for my first class because, um, it was really hard for me to get up 'cause it's a Friday. Thank God it's Friday! Um, I didn't have, um, Business Mathematics class because there was a party going on -- a Christmas party thingy going on at school and then I attended my six to nine class but it was only for an hour and I was so psyched because um, um, so everyone were passing their um, term paper and I've already passed mine two weeks ago. But I was lacking footnotes and research -- I -- I mean, and references but um, like he didn't return it, he didn't return mine. And so after he discussed, um, how to make term papers and he ended the class, I went to him and asked if I could get it and stuff and -- he's an ambassador so it was pretty, like, um, scary to ask and he was really, like, terror ish so. But uh, it was really cool that he knows me. He called me by my name and he said that I should just do good in my final exams and that um, my uh, term paper was okay and that's really awesome, so yeah. Um, yeah, that really psyched me and I'm really happy about that.After that I went to, um, I went to, um, a bazaar in -- in the city -- in -- yeah, in the city -- with -- with my best friend and -- and his mom. So it's pretty cool. Anyway, I got to shower and head to bed because, um, my friend's celebrating her eighteenth debut -- I mean her eighteenth birthday -- her debut tomorrow.So, yeah.

So that'll be fun.But I know I keep getting yelled at, like I'm nervous about waiting for character performer results. But everybody's like, it doesn't matter, you're already in the program, you're already going down, you have attractions so what's there to be worried about? So not much new, well yeah.So nothing new's been going on with me. We're chilling at school right now. Um, the semester's crazy busy, coming to a close. There's half a week this week 'cause this week's Thanksgiving, then all week next week and then I only have like three finals. So I only have finals on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday and that's if I have my final on Thursday. I hope not. That would be awesome.I am, uh, really excited for the semester to be over. I'm sad but I'm happy. I mean I'm sad because it means that I'm not gonna see anybody that I see at school all the time anymore. I only have two -- just under two -- well just about two weeks, uh, to see them, left. So they haven't scheduled times to get together with me so I guess they don't care. Ouch.Seven weeks until I am in Florida. I will be in Florida -- in Orlando -- seven weeks from today. I leave in forty seven days, I think. I leave the Saturday before my check in. My check ins January thirteenth, if I can't say that enough. And it's going to be a lot of fun. I'm really excited for my trip down. Um. I'm going with a certain somebody. I don't know who.

I mean I don't know if he's changed plans on me again. Last I talked to him -- for the last two weeks we've been talking about caravanning down. We're both driving our cars so Ran and I are going to caravan down to Florida. So we're leaving Saturday. Again it's Wednesday. So we're gonna go either to Disney or Universal or Sea World or something or just chill in Orlando for a couple days. That'll be fun.And then on Wednesday when we check in or Tuesday night if you go to the dinner, um, last I heard the dinner is -- uh -- going to be at the Ale House I believe. If not there I think it's B. Dobs if it hasn't been decided. I'm really excited.Also -- um -- for December twenty first, it scares me. These three guys have been planning a Disney CP get together. And you know who they are. You don't name names but if I must name names they are three -- well -- infamous waters. Uh, we'll go here, we'll go here, and we'll go here. Will, Ryan, and John. They have started planning a CP Past, Present, Future get together in the windy cindy -- win -- windy. In the windy -- in Chicago. It's under the Bean -- I guess is where we're gonna meet. We're gonna meet by the Bean in Chicago. If you don't know what the Bean looks like, here's a picture. I went like two years ago. That's my Bean picture. We are meeting in Chicago and it's supposed to be Monday, December twenty first from two to five.If you live in the area and want to go, message one of the boys. I will put it in my sidebar, how to get a hold of them. Um, those are their blogs so you can just go message them through YouTube and let them know that you either have ideas for going -- um -- or -- well ideas for things to do. If you want to go, here's the event link. I'll put that over there too. There's the sidebar. There's -- so you can go there. And it's -- it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun. So far there's like 10 or 12 people that are going. And I'm excited because it's a lot the people that I know or that I can't wait to meet. So I've already met XXXX and XXXX, as you know.I love this. I wish we had a camera -- a stack of cameras.If you didn't know already, I met XXXX and XXXX. John's gonna be there, John XXXX. I'm very excited to meet Nick. We've been talking since May. So that'll be fun. Who else is going? Ashley lives like forty minutes away from me. And if she actually goes then her and I are going to carpool. So that'll be a fun road trip hanging out with her down I think the twentieth or twenty seventh for the CP. We live forty minutes away and we'll both be down in Florida together.And there's a couple other people. Um, I heard my roommate Mandy is coming up with her mom. So that makes me really excited. I get to see her -- bottom up -- before we arrive. And then I hope my roommate -- I nicknamed all of them -- will be there. She hasn't said if she's going or not. to talk about it. I hope she's going to be there too. That'll be fun to see her again. So it'll be a nice little mini reunion. Um, a mini meet -- in -- ahead of time I guess -- to meet all of these people. And it's going to be a lot of fun. So see the sidebar if you want to go.And other than that I'm still waiting for results and -- oh, um, everybody knows this but Space Mountain opened today I guess. Yeah. It's today. Toss some Disney news in there. They've been doing soft openings all week and finally opened. Disney -- there -- there's some really cool videos about, uh, the parks that have been posted on YouTube. Uh, one is about them setting up all the Christmas decorations in the front of Magic Kingdom so sidebar will have that link.I was tipped off yesterday -- I know I'm stealing his thunder and he'll kill me for it later if he watches my blogs. I was told yesterday by Nick that -- all about the mouse pod cast on iTunes -- what were pod casts -- yeah -- about the mouse pod casts that's on iTunes -- whatever. That's how I found it. Did an episode this week where they talked about the CP. I started listening to it. It's about twenty minutes into the pod cast that they actually get to the CP portion and it involves one of the skippers. That's -- that's pretty cool. You can go listen to that. Um, I'll give details so you'll remember in the sidebar. I think that's it. This is a pretty long blog. Other than that I'm really excited. Uh, two weeks left in the semester. Seven weeks -- spend time in Florida. I'm already packing as you can tell. This used to have a bunch of pictures behind it. And this wall had all these pictures and they're all packed. They're all gone. I packed my summer clothes, my closet. I'm packing more -- um -- well soon more packing instead of doing homework. I have a lot of homework to do too. That's bad. So -- but I am going to go and I hope everyone has a magical day. And we'll see you real soon.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG103","Hi XXXX, it's XXXX, and this is just a quick little update to let you know how I'm doing. Um, I went to a retreat with the church, um, last weekend and, um, when I got up there, I couldn't eat anything. Um, my -- I don't know if it was like the altitude or like what, but my band got really tight and I couldn't eat anything. When I came back, um, my weight was down to on seventy seven. Um, and then after a couple of days of being home, then my weight started to get back to normal but I still couldn't eat so I had to go back to see my surgeon and get a little bit of food out of my band and they took out one cc, putting me at four point two.Everybody, this is XXXX. Um, I'm on my retreat right now. I got here last night. It was -- it was dark when I got here, so, uh, I came last year but, um, this year I came with the intentions of running in the mornings. Well, last night I was all pumped, looking to get up early this morning and run, so I get up early, earlier than I'd like to at least, um, start running. Before I know it, I'm going downhill and suddenly I'm going uphill. It's cold and, uh, my Central Valley California self is evasive. So, I wanted to do a video, and I wanted to run. Came back out of here to the little trail they out here in the neighborhood. You can see me and just like the other part that I was running on, it's all uphill and downhill and it's raining. It's muddy and it's wet. And I'm not exactly sure where I'm at. But I'm looking to stop walking at least. I don't think I'm going to get any more running done. Now, I brought my jump rope with me. If I had any brains in my head, I would go back and jump rope for however long 'til I decided to pass out. But now I'm half way through this little adventure of mine. It feels like I'm going to die. I was thinking, this is going to be a breeze 'cause I went to the gym only. I've been running a mile, you know, and I've been doing it under ten minutes, I feel like I'm gonna die now seriously. Breather, really quick. When I get to the top, because standing at an angle is no fun. I said the top and the more steps I take, the more higher it gets. Geez. So, my sister's going to see this video posting and she's going to laugh at me. I'm really -- I've got to stop. If, uh, I don't know if you can see down there. I'm pretty high, I mean, way down there is the cars. I don't know if you could see them or not. Ooh, let's not fall off the side though. Okay, my cousin got up with me. She said, Let's go down to the showers and take showers and get ready for our day today.  I want to run before I take a shower and she's just like, What?  She's like, Well, I got flip flops on so I'm not running with you.  I swear I saw sneakers in her bag though. Rachel. I feel like I'm gonna die. Looks like I'm almost there guys. Looks like I'm almost there. I have not breathed so hard in forever. This uphill stuff is just not my thing. Course I didn't think it was uphill when I started. Looks like it's going down guys. I've been walking, the video says four minutes and fifty one seconds. But I turned it on half way through. I'm starting to make my way downhill. Over there must have been the cabins. And then -- okay. Not sure what that is. Don't look like a kitchen. Maybe these are the cabins. Maybe I found my way back to the cabins. Should I share my music? Right, this song's forty minutes long. Let's see, where's my cabin? I should go wake everybody up. I don't think this is my cabin though. I think I'm lost. I'll do another later. I think I'm lost right now in the woods, in the rain and it's wet. Oh, this is kind of weird. I'm like I have to get in so I guess I'm going around, again. Okay, well it was nice seeing you guys and I'll have to splice this video later. All right, bye.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG104","What's the one thing you can't go a day without? Okay, you have food and water and breathing. So, those are a given. Ron, you know what I'm talking about. Right.Ninety eight percent of you -- I'm really just making that statistic up, but I'm venturing a guess that it's pretty close to being right -- ninety eight percent of you can't go a day without listening to music, and most of that music that you listen to wouldn't be there if there wasn't someone to teach it.That's why this year, for the project for Austin , I'm going to talk to you guys about VH1 Save the Music program. Music programs are something that are really close to my heart, and it's something that I spend a lot of time with. I was in concert bands for seven years throughout um, junior high and high school, marching band all four years of high school, color guard and winter guard all throughout high school, and I've danced basically since I could walk, so for the last seventeen years.Every single one of those activities involved some kind of music, whether it's playing it, learning new music, learning a new instrument, listening to it, choreographing routines to it, whatever, it invov -- it involves some kind of music, and that music wouldn't be there if there wasn't a program for someone to teach.When I graduated from high school in two thousand and six, our band program consisted of almost two hundred fifty members, and our choir program was equal in size. high school now has two high schools, and the music programs at both high schools consist of about one hundred students each.It's not so much the interest in the programs are dropping; it's the fact that there aren't funds to make these programs possible any more. The VH One Save the Music Foundation provides grants of new musical instruments to public, elementary and middle schools that don't currently have any instrumental music program in place. Most of these schools don't have a program already in place because there's just not the funds to teach it. The school district doesn't have the funds to buy the instruments or to hire the directors or to buy music.It may not seem like it, but if you walk into any high school band room, the equipment and the instruments that are in that room are probably equal to a value of the school itself. Even if your school district doesn't qualify for a grant from the Save the Music Foundation, there are a ton of things you can do to keep programs running. The next time your local band or choir comes knocking on your door for a can or bottle drive, see what you have. Give it to them. Chances are you're just going to throw it out anyways.Okay, so it is the middle of December, and it's not really football season any more, but next fall, any Friday night football game, take a second. Watch the band perform at halftime. Even just watching shows support.Does your town have some kind of local fall festival? Winter festival? Anything like that? Chances are there is a band or choir performing at it. Check 'em out. See what they have to offer. Most music programs put on about five or six concerts a year in addition to performing at football games, parades, graduation ceremonies, and things like that.Even if you can't afford to help out the programs financially, just by showing up is some kind of support. A lot of programs will do a bottle drive or a canned food drive at the concert itself in the place of an admission fee. It's a great way to donate and a great way to stay involved with whatever is going on.So next time you're dancing around your room to your favorite song on the radio -- and you know which one I'm talking about take a second and think about how your life would be if you didn't have that music, if there hadn't been anyone to teach that music.I'm going to post a link in the sidebar to the VH One Save the Music program website and also to another great video at one of my uh, favorite bands put out this morning, the Oceanic Six. They also did the Save the Music program, and you can check out their latest single, which is at the end of their video as well.And I'm going to try to post this as a video response to that and see what happens.So, links in the sidebar. Go check it out. Support your local music program; it's a great thing.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG105","Hello everyone, as you can see it's not Thursday, but I don't care if I own half of this channel I believe that, you know, I can do what ever I want. We don't have any rules. Anyway, the actually reason that I didn't persevere this Tuesday was because well one, posted on Monday and it just seemed weird to post on Tuesday, and two, I was absolutely shattered. Why, you might ask? Well, let's go into that now. See you all had a four day weekend in England well or Crawley to be exact. That is just half and hour by train south of London and it was very good and I have been vlogging about it on my personal channel -- oh, that reminds me, I should really post the last post of that. I should really get on that. So, it's been an eventful week after the whole karate thing. On Monday we went into London and we went to the British Museum for this exhibition and it was really good. We went around London and saw all the sights and stuff kind of got a visit. And I got loads of photos and stuff, which will probably be going on my last video on my personal channel and then on Tuesday, we had like half a day cause we had to like get to the airport then so we went into Crawley, into the actual town, and we went into HMV and got some DVDs one of which was this, Dark Than Black volumes one and two which is episodes one to ten. Very good series, I really do recommend it and then, as I said, after we got back, I was shattered and then I was back to school on Wednesday, the entire day of which we went on this careers exhibition at Rotterdam Park Hotel in Quark. It's this thing where loads of colleges and universities from the UK and Ireland are represented and I got plenty of literature such as this CIT prospectus and, you know, it was very informative, very interesting and it wasted the day. And on Thursday it was back to proper school and that was real culture shock and then it was today and I am now reading this book The Star that's written by H. G. Wells. It was written in like the thirties or something, but it is very good, I would recommend this as well. And over the weekend I have to do an art essay and I've opted to do this film for it, so that should be fun. I think that is everything. Ah, Luke, I will see you whenever. What was that? I don't know. What was I going for there? On to the music section.","High","High","High"
"VLOG106","Hello everybody. So today marks a really cool day. You guys can go, right now, and download my song off of iTunes. I know what you're saying, what, XXXX, your song? Since when do you sing? I don't sing, and I know enough about music to know that I'm not a singer. Erm, but what I did, is, I worked with a really, er, a very talented, very cool, group of people out of Europe to create, like, a trance/techno, er, song, and I did voice over for it. And what they did with it, is just, it's freaking awesome, and I'm telling you, it is hot. It is like, have awesome sex to it hot. Erm, so, you probably, you just heard a little bit of it and you can go over to iTunes, you can hear a sample of it, and, it's just -- it is so -- I think you guys are going to absolutely love it.Now, here's the thing. If you guys don't love it, I'm not going to do music video, erm, but if you guys love it as much as I think you will, and hope you do, erm, and if sales over there are, you know, adequate enough, we're gonna make a really, really kick ass music video, erm, to probably put on YouTube, and then to also sell on iTunes. But to put out there on YouTube so you guys can see it, erm. We have a production team put together -- er, it could be just so, I mean, hear the song, use your imagination, it's going to be an awesome, awesome video. Erm, if you guys are interested in the song. So I'm going to put the link, over here, and, erm, yeah, over there you can like, download it, not just from iTunes, but if you use other programs, like Amazon, Rhapsody, Napster, all of those, you can download it from like this hub. Erm, so I'm really excited, and please, oh my goodness, please write me, and tell me what you think of it, because that is awesome. And when way you can tell me what you think of it is by calling my number, erm, for those of you, you totally came to use this to work out what the hell that number is, thinking I'm a psycho, who's put my personal number out there on the internet, you can choose to, whether or not you want to, you don't have to if you don't want to call it, but you can choose to sign up for alerts, each time I have news, erm, it can get sent to your 'phone, and, and of course like the main point is that you guys can leave me messages there.So, anyway, I think it's hot as hell, and you know, I ramble on and on, so I'll actually keep this, maybe, under five minutes, I don't know, we'll see. Erm, I love you guys, and I will talk to you really, really soon. I just had something like, five popsicles, so I'm hyper. Okay. I love you guys, mwa, mwa, 'bye.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG107","﻿All right. So, I'm a total liar and I don't blame you if you unsubscribe, but, huh, if you're not going to keep watching my videos for me, at least keep watching them for him. What do you think about that song?I've been here for thirty something years looking at myself in the same dirty mirror.Isn't it always kind of weird when you get, like, randomly called by someone? And then they leave a voice mail. I'm kinda scared to hear it, 'cause that was somebody I met at a coffee shop, like, a month ago and I got their number and they are just, like, calling me and it's really weird 'cause it's, like, three in the afternoon.Who calls someone they met -- met at a coffee shop at three in the afternoon, like, a month after they met you? I don't know, maybe I'm just being weird. I don't think -- I think they're really cool; it's just kind of strange like.I bet it's, like, one of those calls, like, Hi, I found this number in my phone and I was wondering who it is? This is Jamie, you met me at a coffee shop, remember, I'm really awesome.  We'll see, we'll listen to the message. Maybe I'll listen to it and then I'll let you listen to it, but probably not.So, my tattoo. Yes, I still have it. Imagine that. All right, so I think in my last video I said it was a milk thistle. Um, I said that it was a Scottish flower, but actually, it doesn't grow in Scotland, it grows in Middle Eastern regions. Um, just to clear that up, but people of Scottish heritage do get it as a -- as a tattoo.Um, it's usually more of a stylized version -- it looks more like a symbol rather than the actual plant. Um, whereas I went for a more detailed look, but anyways, now down to spiritual meaning.So the milk thistle plant has been regarded for centuries and centuries as a very highly powerful medicine, um, in terms of, um, it has been used for detoxification of the liver and also it's known for its anti cancer effects, which are two pretty awesome things. Um, you can actually buy milk thistle extract at Wild Oats.Silence .And the reason why those two attributes of the plant really spoke to me and I thought it be a good thing to perm -- permanently adorn my body with is because one, alcohol -- alcoholism is something that really affects my family. Um, my aunt is in her sixties and right now, she's suffering majorly from the long terms effects -- long term effects of alcohol.Um, I personally have had issues with alcohol. I started drinking when I was 12. Um, I -- I was kind of a crazy kid for a while and -- so I wanted to put this thing permanently on my body, um, have it be the thorn on my -- the thorn in my side. God, I can't talk today. The thorn in my side to constantly remind me never to put my body in jeopardy for mental comfort.Because I'm a firm believer that anything that's going to put your physical health in jeopardy, isn't going to bring you mental comfort in the long run. Um, I think that mind, body and soul, spirit, they will -- they should be able to be happy all in the same context and in harmony with each other and so you need to keep finding that perfect balance between mental happiness and physical happiness before you are going to be truly happy.So, I have a thorn in my side to always remind me of that. Um, and I don't mean not to drink, I do enjoy, you know, well actually I don't 'cause I'm only twenty, so it's illegal.Anyways, and then the anti cancer effects, um, that's pertaining to my grandmother. She is a breast cancer survivor. She had her right breast removed and so my tattoo's on my right side.Pretty simple, um, but definitely a deep meaning and I'm guessing you want to see it again because the last video I did was pretty shitty, it was pretty dark and I was all giddy and I just wanted to really quickly show it to you. And it probably looks something like a demented elephant head.I'm not sure, but, uh. I actually made some footage a couple days after I got it, 'cause right now it's peeling or else I'd, like totally show you. But, um, I made some footage like three days after I made that first video, 'cause I was going to post a video like I promised, but I didn't get around to finishing it, so I'll just show you that 'cause that shows it pretty well and it's not peeling and it looks cool.So here goes.","Low","High","Low"
"VLOG108","﻿Hi, I was watching the video about Brittany Murphy, and I understand I was in shock when I found out she died. Not so much that Brittany Murphy herself died, but more that she died young. Like, Karen Carpenter, you know, in cardiac arrest, very young. Something that could have easily been preventable. It makes me think about what am I going to do with my life? Um, how much more time do I have to live? What about people who are in Iraq, dying of preventable diseases like AIDS, swine flu, stuff like that. Brittany Murphy, at least is seems, lived a full life despite that she died so young, and it makes me think what are we going to do when we die? I want you to listen to this clip I got from CMT; and after I speak on it tell me what you think. In case you don't recognize the song, it's Tim McGraw's Live Like You Were Dying. Listen carefully.I was in my early forties,With a lot of life before me,And a moment came that stopped me on a dime.I spent most of the next days,Looking at the x rays,And talking about the options and talking about sweet time.I asked him when it sank in,That this might really be the real end?How's it hit you when you get that kind of news?Man whatcha do?I went sky diving, I went rocky mountain climbing,I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu.And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter,And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying.Some day, I hope you get the chance,To live like you were dying.He said I was finally the husband,That most the time I wasn't.And I became a friend a friend would like to have.And all of a sudden going fishing,Wasn't such an imposition,And I went three times that year I lost my Dad.Well, I finally read the Good Book,And I took a good long hard look,At what I'd do if I could do it all again,I went sky diving, I went rocky mountain climbing,I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu.And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter,And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying.Someday, I hope you get the chance,To live like you were dying.Like tomorrow was a gift,And you got eternity,To think about what you'd do with it.And what did you do with it?And what can I do with it?And what would I do with it?Sky diving, I went rocky mountain climbing,I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu.And then I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter,And I watched Blue Eagle as it was flying.Some day, I hope you get the chance,To live like you were dying.To live like you were dying.To live like you were dying.As I think about that song, you know, this guy was in his forties and he was dying of cancer. I know someone that lost her mother at the age of fifty from cancer and it makes me think. This really makes me think. By the way, I'll bet, oh, sorry. There we go, we got that paused, I'm sorry I was on CMT so it could take off, I didn't realize I didn't have a pause but again, that song makes me think. You know, what are we going to do? We think we have forever and yet we do not. Life is finite. Think about all the people that have, that you've lost in a year, whether it be a friend in Iraq or whether it be somebody's mother died of AIDS, somebody's father died of cancer, and for that, for Tim McGraw, I'll bet that song is very personal. I do not believe he wrote it. I don't think that, um, he writes most of his songs, but, but I'll bet you all didn't know he lost his father the year before. Nonetheless, it is a very personal song, and if you really listen to it, doesn't it make you think? I'm sure Brittany Murphy, too, thought that she was going to live forever. I'm sure all of us think, but now, after seeing her death, you know, just reminds us -- shouldn't we treat every day as if that day were our last? Thank God for that reminder.Rest in peace, Brittany.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG109","Hello, YouTube. Um, it is two thirty in the morning, I was up watching a movie, yay, Driving Lessons with Rupert Grint and Julie Walters, it's a good movie.Um, I just wanted to say thanks to all of you who left kind comments to my video response, John, and hopefully I'll be making more videos um, got a webcam going now, cause, you know, I wanna see if I'll actually do this before I invest in a decent actual video camera.But, other than that, things are quiet in Florida, hot and humid and waiting for Hannah. Uh, yeah, it's . All I'm gonna say tonight is I am tired but I did want to say hi, so hi and good night.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG11","﻿Hello, everyone. It's XXXX. Hi, XXXX. This morning I enjoyed watching your One Man's Opinion video and you may be surprised to learn that I have no disputes, no disagreements with uh, basically, anything that you said.But I think that where -- and you can tell me if I'm wrong -- where our opinions might begin to diverge is what happens after you try your best at being a bootstrap kind of guy, uh, and you fail. I mean, we all know what happens if we work hard and if we are successful and we can take care of ourselves. Life is good. But the missing pieces -- what happens when things awry?Now oftentimes it's through no fault of the person. For instance, somebody loses a job and in turn loses their healthcare. A person who gets sick and gets dropped from his coverage, or a person who has a preexisting condition and can't get coverage at any kind of an affordable rate. I mean, what do we do with people like that -- people like that who, by the way, could be you -- could be me, no one knows what tomorrow will hold.And we -- in most of my videos, uh, I like to note that I don't necessarily try to be persuasive, uh, to get people to see my point of view or to change to my point of view. I happen to be a persuasive guy so that just happens but it's -- it's not the intent. Normally what I'm trying to do is, you delve into a concept, something above the -- the fray, something above the raucous, misfit -- uh -- that's normally the political debate.For instance, in the healthcare debate, everyone's talking about things that have nothing to do with healthcare itself. So, you know, diving into those things doesn't really do any good. I'm trying to get above that, and, you know, maybe talk about things that are important to people. That might be something worth talking about, and that's .Uh, when I was watching your video, I started to think, you know, we -- we all feel proud of being American. It's a great country. But what are we really saying when we're saying we're proud to be American? Is it just, we're proud of our achievements? Do we care at all about those who, for whatever reason, are having difficulties?To me, the country -- being a part of the country is akin to being a part of any other community. And any community, whether it be family, friends, neighborhoods -- it's not uncommon for there to be an outreached hand or to try to help those who have a need.This particular discussion about healthcare -- it's really scary to me that those who have healthcare now, like myself, settle that they're okay and they very well might be today. But we have to think about what will happen tomorrow. Now -- and the insurance companies have thrown a whole lot of money into derailing this, and unfortunately, they're being successful. And I touched upon that in my last video.But I've got to think that people should be more -- should be more foresighted and see that this is not a debate only for insuring those who do not have insurance. It's a debate to try to make the entire insurance business one that will not run us into bankruptcy. And I think that as a country, we should pull together to fix what is clearly a broken, uh, system. Some things -- I'm a capitalist, I assure you, and I'm out there trying to make money like everyone else.But some things do not work within capitalism alone. Governments have a place. Hopefully it's to do the will of the people and also to do the right thing even if sometimes it's unpopular, as was the initial, uh, vote on Social Security. There were many people who were saying saying things they're just saying now about the horrors that would happen. They were saying the same things then that they're saying now. And none of those things happened.It indicates -- looking back on my whole life, I know that someone gave me an opportunity, deserved or undeserved. Someone did. It had nothing to do with my abilities, or my will, or my perseverance. I could be the brightest guy in the world -- which I'm not -- but if I were, I still would need someone else to give me a chance. Someone forgave my youthful indiscretions, my youthful impertinence. Someone thought it was a good idea to provide education for our young. Someone decided it was important to build roads. Someone also thought that it would be a good idea to provide health insurance and healthcare to people -- Americans -- when they got old. Someone decided to build -- to build systems for clean water and systems to dispose water through sewage.These are all things that an individual cannot accomplish. So for those who say that government has no place, I think that's wrong. Now what happens sometimes is that this process gets corrupted, and consequences ensue which you and me are not happy with. But I think it's not even debatable that there is a place for government and that there are many things that individuals -- the best and the brightest, the luckiest, whatever category you want to put them in -- cannot achieve on their own.So I believe that now is one of those times, just like when we built the roads or the water, sewage. We should find a way to fix the healthcare system, to find a way to be good Americans and take care of one another.Bye bye now","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG110","Hello everyone. This is the XXXX, and it is official, Tiger Woods has just admitted that transgressions have caused the integrity of his family to be in question here. And, if you haven't been following along, there's been a lot of shit going down with Mr. Woods, and if you don't know who he is look him up. He's a professional golfer, you know, perhaps you've heard of him. And the other day he got in a car accident -- I'm probably gonna use the quote fingers a lot here. Uh, he got in a car accident on Fri -- last Friday, uh, and it was reported that there was a possible martial dispute between he and his wife. And a number of rumors have been circulating and it turns out that Tiger Woods was having a relationship. And the specifics of the relationship, you know, not to, you know, throw Tiger completely under the bus, but the specifics of this relationship with one Jamiee Grubbs surfaced.Now, a number of pieces of evidence have come fourth, and one of which was a phone call that Jamiee Grubbs had on her phone. And it was Tiger calling her, you know, saying, hey, you know, my wife is on us, um, please remove your -- my name from your phone, so that way when I call it just shows up as a number, not as, you know, Tiger, or whatever, blah, blah, blah. And it was -- it was basically Tiger doing cover up work because he didn't want the truth of the matter to get out here, which was basically his admission of guilt in the matter.So, the proof is in the pudding, and Tiger Woods literally just put out a statement, ah, saying that he regrets the transgressions -- and I love the fact that he used transgressions, and, um, such a -- such a lawyer word -- but um, he put out this statement saying, you know, he -- he is sorry that what he has done has caused his family grief, and, um, it may turn out that the, uh, the quote unquote accident that happened was his wife flipping the hell out and beating the shit out of him and his Cadillac. So, it's -- it's kind of amazing here, it -- and I find this amazing in a number of ways. Number one, it's not really, uh, particularly anyone's business as to what exactly went down, um, I mean, just -- I feel that people are gonna go too far with this, and they're gonna delve in, and try to find every detail and -- okay, Tiger Woods is caught.His hand is in the cookie jar, he can't deny this, he has the phone calls, they have the car accident, they have the pissed off wife -- I mean, Tiger's not gonna be able to recover from this and just, you know, pat everyone on the back and be like, oops, my bad, let's all just move on. So, people are probably gonna delve into this too much, but the reason why I said this is amazing is that this is another example of just another guy being a dumb shit. Now, you guys have to understand, Tiger Woods is just this multi million dollar commodity, if you will. He's this wholesome, clean cut image that has been relatively flawless in his career, and the path that he's chosen for his career. I mean, he is the go to guy that you would want advertising your product, he's the guy a politician would want endorsing him, he is everything.And yet, he got caught up in a relationship outside of his marriage that could have nothing but damning ramifications if things were discovered. Why the hell, Tiger, would you risk all that just for some pussy? And let's be realistic, that's what it was. Have you seen this girl? I don't think Tiger was talking to her 'cause she's, you know, great conversation at the dinner table. Maybe he was, okay, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he was, but you know what, she's a piece of ass, she's hot as hell. I mean, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out why Tiger was talking to this girl. So, it -- just, one thing I just want to say out there is just these guys who get caught in relationships like this -- how can you not be petrified of going into a relationship like this? Tiger is married, Tiger has two kids, Tiger has this career, and this public image that is flawless.What if this Jaimee Grubbs girl wanted to blackmail him? And for all we know, maybe that's what happened here. Maybe she was trying to get some information out of him, and got this voicemail and other information -- she will sell it to the highest bidder at this point. And rumor has it, Us Weekly paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars just for that voicemail that got released that Tiger had called Jaimee with. So, why do people like Tiger Woods risk everything just for some extramarital relationship? Like, Tiger, was it really worth it? Was it worth it to risk your entire career? And God knows how much you're gonna be able to recover from this, 'cause your squeaky clean image is shot. I mean, not to take anything away from his golf play, because he's gonna go down as the greatest man to ever play that sport.And yes, I call it a sport, even though some people will argue it's not a sport. But anyways, um, I don't know, I just -- I just find this amazing. It's just -- it's just another squeaky clean guy that everyone could look up to -- he just let people down, he just let people down with this. I mean it's like you're in a happy marriage that, well, looks happy, I mean we don't know behind closed doors. But, why can't you just be happy with the wife and the kids and everything, and just set a good example? And like I said, Tiger, what the hell would you have done if this lady decided to blackmail you? You don't think that there's people out there, uh, just women and men for that matter, that are trying to find, uh, multi millionaires to con out of their money and get a inch of information that they can blackmail you with?Turns out this Jaimee Grubbs had a lot more than that. And like I said, not that she's absolutely blackmailed him, but, boy, if she wanted to do that, he gave her quite a bit of information to do so with. So, I don't know, people, what the hell do you think? Is Tiger Woods just retarded for this? Because, in all honesty, that's the only way I can look at it. It's just an absolute act of just retarded behavior. You have the world in the palm of your hand, and you're just gonna throw it away with shit like this. Shame on you, Tiger, what the hell where you thinking? So, anyways here people, um, yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be more details to come out on this, and I'll probably end up making a follow up video 'cause I don't think we've heard the half of it yet.'Cause there is gonna be a lot more to be said, and uh, we're probably gonna have to buckle up, but like I said, it isn't really anyone's business, anything else that happened beyond this. But um, yeah, go ahead and drop your thoughts and opinions -- I'm sure you guys have your own renditions of what you think went down here. But um, Tiger, disappointed in you, um, you know. I don't really care too much about golf but I can respect your game, and uh, that image you held out as being an upstanding citizen and, you know, having the wife and kids and all that -- it's all gone now. It's all shot. It's all shot. You're just -- you're just now no more than a typical male that cheated on his wife.And, yeah, cheated includes even if you didn't have any sort of sexual relationship -- cheating involves all that was going on, 'cause, like I said, that phone message you left her, that didn't sound like someone, you know, you didn't want to talk to because you were talking about world affairs over dinner with. So, yeah, Tiger, shame on you, and um, God knows how much you're gonna be able to recover from this, and God knows what else is gonna come out, but I'll be watching to see what else comes out next, cause, yeah, it's gonna be a bumpy ride for you. Have a great day everyone.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG111","Hiya! Today's vlog is brought to you by echo, echo, echo, echooo. See how the only purpose why I'm making this video is, because I recorded something earlier just to try it. Um, if you could hear the echo in this room through the camera or through the camera and yes you can.And I think that it's funny, because this is the room where I always recorded my videos when I was at my dad's; you know, the one with the red chair. There's no red chair anymore, because some -- that -- the entire room is empty. It's empty and it's dirty, because, um, behind all the furniture there is dirt. And I don't know how old that dirt is, but it's probably, probably old and disgusting.Let me show you what I mean. I'm going to give you a three hundred and sixty of my empty room. Isn't that exciting? I know, I know, yeah, I see. Um, okay. So, there it starts; wall, there, urr, ah, ah, there, eww, eww, ich, my nails, eww, gross. Okay, moving on; my door, um, a coke bottle I forgot to sweep up. And eww, look at that, eww, disgusting. Am -- Am I pointing? I don't -- I can't see the screen. I don't know, but eww, eww.Okay, so I'm just gonna do this. I have no idea what I'll find in the house, but I'm sure you can see that is disgustingly dirty. And, there, there, there, see that? Eww, eww, eww eww, there, oh, yuck, there you see that, ah. Gross, gross, err, anyway, um, yeah that was my room, hah exiting. Oh, and if I didn't realize that I'm lying on the floor. And the floor is just as dirty as the walls, but then again my toes are dirty from throwing all that stuff out and worn from carrying boxes that seem to be, like, I don't know, just as heavy as me. And, it's just my back does not feel too cheerful, let me tell you that.Anyway, ah, so that's the only purpose why I am making this video, because I thought that it was funny to have such an echo in a room that used to be not echoey at all. And the same echo always reminds me of Mr. Echo, um, yeah. I don't know what I'm saying now. I just thought that I'd make a video and I like the color of my socks and the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, the end .","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG112","﻿Hey, guy. Good night, everyone. This is so unfair, um, it is after midnight here and actually I had intended to just go to sleep and make a video tomorrow maybe, but after reading my comments and my private messages and reading the comments on my channel I just had to say hello. Hello.The reason why I didn't make a video any sooner was because my weekend is occupied with car problems. As you know, I have a small car and I travel long distances; I travel a lot all over Holland and my car has been giving me trouble for I think a month now. Every time I go on the highway it will just start shaking and the garage couldn't find out what was wrong, but now they do know it's the gas pump and it's going to cost me a lot of money, but that isn't what I wanted to tell you.What I wanted to tell you, first of all, is thank you for the comments and for, well, making me feel like I'm being heard and that is wonderful; and that is going to be my message today; to keep on trying; always keep on trying, even when you think that what you are doing is not worth it.A teacher of mine asked me two weeks ago, what it was that I wanted to -- what the message was that I wanted to give to people -- or not the message not so much, but the impression I wanted to leave on people. I've thought about it for two entire weeks and I couldn't come up with an answer. I couldn't. I thought I wanted people to like me and therefore usually I hide and say nothing. I thought if I'd be quiet and just accept everything, people would like me. This YouTube experience has taught me that that is not the case. People will always comment on how my nose looks wrong or my overall face is not good today or -- and it's not my goal to be liked.I want to defend people who cannot voice what they have to say and are silent. And usually the silent ones are the ones with great opinions and I think they need to be acknowledged -- and that is what I hope to do, to acknowledge everyone who has his or her pretty opinions or strong devotions or dreams or hopes or aspirations.I think most people are very beautiful. I'm not talking about outside opinions; I'm talking about inside. For so long I felt I wasn't being heard and you often made me feel like I am -- and that I'm actually portraying something good. And now I know what it is that I want to leave people.I want people to think of me as someone who acknowledges -- who understands; and I hope you think I'm actually succeeding; and I hope that you know that you mustn't give up like I haven't given up on me, on anorexia, on young people. People should be who they are and you should be who you are; and no matter how rude comments are, I will always be XXXX, and not someone else, but you guys can only give me more self esteem; give me more courage; give me more -- make me believe in myself more, but not less; definitely not less.I don't easily get moved by much, but you have moved me. So I just wanted you to know that I thank you very much, and I wish you all a good night.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG113","﻿Hello. Okay. This is just going to be real quick, get to the point, um. First off, I'm going to have a contest, um, soon.

Well, actually one grand prize winner and the second two prize winners will be the same 'cause everyone took it. You know, all the nice presents stuff.Um, I got more highlights to my hair. It's a lot lighter. It looks a lot better, this video is really dark and it really sucks, but my webcam is broken, so that's going to put a little damper in my parade for this.But, um, I've actually been getting some donations and what not from a fashion blog that I have and I'm gonna kind of use that money for the contest instead of the blog, but, you know, same difference. But, anyway. Um, there's going to be, like, I think three tutorials I'll have up that are gonna kind of, you know, relate to the contest and whatnot, but, uh, more information on that when I know exactly what's going on and I'm really want to get the prizes around so I can show you guys what I have for you because I'm really excited to like give this stuff away 'cause it makes me, I don't know, happy.But anyway, thank you for watching and thank you for everyone who subscribed to me, um, recently.

"VLOG118","Hey everyone, I just want to talk about something that has been in the news lately -- well at least American news -- and it's the balloon boy. For all of you international viewers who don't know who the balloon boy is, apparently there is this family who lives in Colorado and they are crazy; and they basically believe in aliens and do all this weird like scientist shit, except not real science, because they believe in all this wacky crap. And basically they set off a balloon, not like a little toy balloon, but this weird spaceship shaped balloon; and the father set it off and then they realized they couldn't find their son. They thought their son was in the balloon and we've been calling him the balloon boy for the past day or so. And he was like -- and the balloon was floating over Colorado for two hours; and for two hours we all thought that this boy was floating in this balloon.And then the balloon lands, and we realized that it's empty and we realized the boy was actually in the attic of the house; and he wasn't in the balloon; and we were all just talking about a balloon floating in the sky for two hours.Yeah, so it's understandable that we would cover that, because you know there was a chance that this boy could have died. He was like floating around in space, but he wasn't. That's the point. He wasn't in the balloon, and even though we're learning more about this family, how they're kinda of crazy and how they are bad parents, but, um, that's not news; that's really -- that's not news. Um, and even though it's not news our media has decided to cover it twenty four seven. By our media I mean, CNN; FOX, which no one should watch and MSNBC. These three major news stations, even my beloved MSNBC can't stop talking about the balloon boy.Honestly, really, the stock market just went over ten thousand or whatever for the first time in over a year. It's going up. It's going up. Do you remember I said that in my last video? People like, yeah, Barak Obama it's going up and it's hit a record point for over a year, but we're talking about a little boy that we thought was in a balloon that wasn't. Really.The health care debate is finally coming to like to a merging point where the Congress and the Senate have to like agree to merge a final bill and we're talking about a boy who we thought was in a balloon but wasn't. Really.You know when our society crumbles before our eyes and when Sarah Palin takes over the world with Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and we look back at where did we all go wrong. It's when our media started talking about the balloon boy. It's when our media decided that the balloon boy was more important to discuss than the stock market, healthcare, the economy -- you know, the stimulus package that is working by the way. You know, big stuff like that, no, no, no, we're going to talk about the balloon boy. And even after the balloon boy has landed, we're going to talk about how bad the parents of the balloon boy are, and then we're going to put that family on every single freaking news show in the next twenty four hours, interview after interview and watch the little boy. He literally threw up on television. On the Today Show this morning, he threw up. He vomited on television. News show after news show, this is what we're talking about, you know -- Barak Obama, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, healthcare go merging, fuck that. Stimulus bill -- it's working, more signs that it's working, fuck that. Stock market hits ten thousand for the first time in over a year, fuck that. We're not even talking about like anything that could possibly be twisted to be related to current events. No, we're talking about the balloon boy.You know, Thomas Jefferson talked about an enlightened electorate and electorate and the only way that democracy can succeed is if we have an enlightened electorate. Meaning that voters know -- know what they are talking about. How are we supposed to know what we are talking about when the people who are supposed to tell us are talking about a balloon boy?","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG119","Hey everyone, I'm 's mom, um, I'm also known as XXXX, um. Okay, so this is my first video so I'm a little nervous and it might be a little retarded, but, um, after talking to XXXX, which I'm sure most of you've been -- you know, um, she told me to make one, and I did.So, um, I just got back from, um, the Food Network Night, um, with a couple of moms and it was delicious, the food was amazing. Like, I made, um, , um, strawberry and peach cobbler, and it was a little rubbery. The cobbler really didn't come up, like stayed at the bottom so it was -- it was good, but it was like rubbery. Um, then I also made potatoes, which were also really, really good. Then everybody else made awesome recipes and I'm stuffed, and it's one thirty in the morning and I'm making a video, um, but I figure since my hair was kinda nice, um, that I would make a video now instead of tomorrow.Um, and it's in black and white because, um, it doesn't show the flaws, but don't tell anybody that. Um, so I'm gonna try to blog, not every day, but sometimes see how I like it. If I get I great response I'll continue, if not then I won't. Um, I really don't want to make videos that no one reply to them or nothing, because then that's stupid. I'll just feel dumb, so we'll see how it goes.Um, I even thought about doing a, um, blog for coupons, because I am a coupon freak. I'm one of those ladies that stand at the check out lane for thirty minutes while they scan my coupons. Um, I do purchases like before coupons to a hundred and something dollars, up to coupons lower than twenty bucks. So I'm really like crazy about them, so I figure I could maybe teach some few people on here, if I get some interest. If not, then I'll just make goofy videos. Um, and I really don't know how to edit videos, but I'm gonna try and we'll see what I can come up with.Um, I think that's it for now. Um, like I said its one thirty in the morning; I probably should get some sleep since I have no child tonight, um, so I hope that you guys enjoy this video.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG12","So, um, ehh, I don't know -- I don't know what else I can say. I'm just too fast you little fuckers. And when the thoughts goes -- goes too well; just letting the thoughts come rolling.I saw Nine Inch Nails live, my favorite band. I saw, you know, I saw Nine Inch Nails, my favorite band, live, back in November. November the fifth, to be exact. Uh, right after the election. That was fucking amazing concert.Um, I think I'm going to call this video the most random shit ever, just the most ra -- I know, I okay -- I know, shh, quiet. I know a lot of my vids are already pretty random but, seriously, what to talk about? So many things in the world to talk about, so many things.Well, fuck politics. I don't know shit about that, or economics, or any of that stuff. I mean, I -- I can say I know a little bit about what's going on, but I'm not gonna get into it. That was never my intention, to start up some blog -- start up some blog where I just chat about, you know, things that I don't know shit about. So -- uh, in other words, I don't know enough to talk about them, or encourage it. You get the idea.I'm not even looking at the camera when I talk, I'm kinda looking off into space. I gotta stop that, I'm not even looking at the camera. Need to just stare at the camera, give it a sexy stare. Just kinda -- you hearing that sound, that little chukka chukka, chukka, chukka? Can you hear it? Chukka chukka, chukka, chukka. Those are my legs; they're shaking to and fro. But they're not shaking out of perverted purposes, perverts. Or pedophiles, you know who you are.Made a pretty pointless vid here. I mean this is very, very terrible -- this is a very terrible video and I'm very sorry. Just keep talking and talking and talking. I'm gonna have a fucking terrible time editing this shit out, when I wake up or whenever I do this.Um, oh yeah, I'm going to go at -- well, I could go -- I could just write it down, but I guess I'll just say it, before I forget about it. I think I orig -- I originally started the video camera, started the webcam with the idea of getting this thought down. That way I could remember it and go back over it. Just uh, some of you may consider this terrible or whatever but some of you may consider it making fun of our -- of our -- of our troops, you know of -- of the -- of the American troops, not going to say our troops.Don't give me that, don't you give me that. I don't own these guys. No, I don't, I don't. And I'm not into this for -- but I'm not getting into politics, okay? I'm staying away from it tonight. Um, yeah, I realize they're humans and all that -- but okay, anyway -- anyway. Okay, so anyway, like I was saying, you know, God bless the strong and brave men and women, your stand around hunter while he's high. God bless our troops, standing around them.I just kinda thought, you know, I was kinda thinking to myself about that, like, seems like whenever I'm a little out of it, or, you know, due to probably some substance or whatever. Well, I guess I'm never really safe to be around. In a certain sense, it's not, like, I'm just going to bust you up all a sudden but, you know, you're obviously not going to have the best dreams after hanging around me for a bit.Anyway, so I'm talking about, you know, like, if I'm a little out of it due to a certain substance or whatever. Um, anyone -- anyone who is around me, you know, who is actually brave enough to stay around me, um, for fear of my, you know, just going too far, um, I gotta give you credit. Gotta give you lots of credit and pats on the backs. Lots of pats on the backs, lots and lots of pats on the backs.I'm getting to that point where I'm not really -- I -- I'm actually pretty tired, but, oh man, I could go to sleep, but I kinda think I wanna stay up for a bit. I'm actually waiting for a gift by um, by Trent Reznor or by Nine Inch Nails. They have it up on their site and Iam. com. They have this thing up there since the seventeenth I think it is, um saying, you know, we may have a new video -- we may -- whoa -- you know, we may have a -- we may have a little hol -- we may have a little holiday gift for you soon, check back.So you have the word may, you have the word soon, where you have those words, and it's just -- those words are so uncertain. Last time they said soon, it took what, two weeks, you know? Two weeks for something to pop up on the site.Um, and then may, it's like a, well, that's -- I mean, Trent is very committed to his fans and Iam is very committed to the Nine Inch Nails community, of course. Um, but you know, when you say the word may, it's kinda like, well I may edit this video tomorrow.But then again, if I'm saying I may, wait hold on . Bless me, thank you, thank you so much. Such a great, great person.But yeah, it's like I'm saying I may edit this video tomorrow. Um, you know, I -- I uh, I may not edit this video tomorrow. May is -- is half and half. That's like saying, well, you know, might do it might not. Either or. Um, but then we got 'em to say may do it soon. That's kinda like well I might do it in the near future or I might not, you know? Might take a long time, it might never be there, it might actually be there pretty soon, and considering it's a holiday gift, you know, I'm thinking okay, let's see what time it is.Well it's about two forty five here, which is fifteen minutes of course 'til -- that is a quarter 'til three, um, which means that it would be midnight over in California, by that point, and that's where Nine Inch Nails is basically located right now, in California, which means their New Year's would strike and the New Year would strike and um, they would -- um, that would be the other -- that would be another opportunity for the whole holiday idea, 'cause Christmas already came and went; there was no gift, you know? But, now this is New Years, so maybe a different situation. So I'm kinda excited about that; I might stay up for a bit.Long tangent there, very long, I know, but well, I love expressing myself.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG120","﻿So yes, this is really is me, this is XXXX. Look. My hair. It's gone bye bye. I was actually gonna wait until, um, after the wedding, and next summer to cut my hair short, but given the style of -- of the gown and I kept looking at up dos and I just didn't really see any that really went with what I wanted. I kinda decided to go ahead and do it down. But, I didn't want it, like, long and down. So, um, right now it's flipped under, but I can flip it out and it can be all -- because it's layered.So I know, I'm sure all of you will have an opinion. I hate it. I love it. How could you? You look ugly now. Oh, you're gorgeous. I don't care. I really don't care to hear any of it. I didn't do it for you guys, and I got permission from my mom and -- and uh, XXXX , not that it matters. Uh, not permission, but you know what I mean.So um, I just kinda wanna update you guys. Um, a couple of things. One is we are close to three hundred dollars raised on the poverty project, which sounds not, like, not that much when you consider everyone, but if you think of it another way, we're ten percent of the way there, and ten percent's quite a bit. It's quite a bit, you know? So, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that, um, I'm not gonna let it go. I'm not going to so, um, if you guys are sick and tired of hearing me talk about it, but you still love me to death, then you're just going to have donate, so we get the three thousand and I quit asking you to go donate. By the way, go donate, on MySpace, blog, um, Fineloss has a donate button. Whatever the last blog I have a donate button on is, that's the most recent total. That's where I keep updating, because I have so many, I don't go back and update every single total. I update the most recent one.Um, let's see, um, more news, um, I just get -- heard a little more from YouTube about this gathering thing. Um, I just got, um -- they sent us a flip, uh, cam -- video camera, which rocks. Um, I already had one. Now apparently, I'll have two, and I'm going to definitely use both. Um, not -- not double fisted. I won't be, like, whooo, look at all that, yeah, you know? No.But XXXX takes a lot of video of um, the doggie cat, which I sh -- don't tell, because it might not -- you know, don't -- it's not for sure yet, but they're -- they're discussing the cat and dog. Are having some talks about having a merger and if they do so, they would have their own channel. So -- and, and they just -- the biggest thing right now is they can't decide on a name. Would it be the Ophelia and Justice Show or the Justice and Ophelia Show?See, Justice says that he should get precedence because no one has seen him yet, really and everyone wants to see his puppy videos and him growing up, and we have all those videos, and he thinks that there's some power to that, you know? He thinks that, um, that exclusivity should get him the first name.But then Ophelia is, like, hey, I've already been on YouTube, I'm tried and true, I have fans, they love me. They're gonna stick by me, bitch. She calls him bitch, even though he's not a bitch, he's a male dog, um, but that -- that's her, you know, she calls -- she calls us all bitch at times. Um, well, she's probably called me a bitch when she doesn't have as much hair to lick and eat on anymore. Um, so, yes, um, that's probably where the other flip phone is gonna go for.But, just so you guys know, I'm gonna give a shout out. I know I don't ever do it on this channel. Um, I don't ever talk about companies or anything, except for my personal one, but hey, shout out to uh, flip phones. Uh, looks like the brand is M I-N O, Mino. I don't know but -- but flip video, um, they're awesome, literally, I mean because I -- I bought one before. I'm not just saying they're awesome because they gave me a free one. I bought one three weeks ago. Yeah, great. Um, and then they're, like, oh yeah, well, Flip is sponsoring this event so you guys get one. That's nice, hah. Shoulda told me three weeks ago.Anyway, um, it just -- it records, um, on flash memory and then you click a button and the USB thing pops out and you just click it in, and you download it to your computer. It is awesome for just taking little videos here and there. Um, definitely an awesome one. So I'm gonna go ahead and plug them. I don't know the website. Google it.Um, the -- the other thing is, okay, yeah, um -- sorry, you're gonna have to move a little bit. Um, YouTube had asked me uh, what my t shirt size was, and I said small if it was unisex, and they ran out of small so they sent me a medium. Well, look fucking cool this is. Yeah, yeah, it says player. That's right, it says -- it says playa, and then on the back of course it says YouTube. I'm a YouTube playa. It's official, they sent it to me. I got a letter, it was handwritten. I can show it to you if you want. But then, since they'd run out of mediums, guess what they sent me? Guess. I'm gonna give you guys a second, just go ahead and guess. They sent me YouTube socks. Hello, I mean, I know I'm being silly, but I mean, hello socks. XXXX, I mean. Can you mix the two anymore? I -- I think I might have to start YouTubing in these socks constantly until they stink so bad XXXX throws them away. I don't know. So, I'm not only a YouTube playa, I have YouTube socks now. I mean, come on.So, I got that package and a handwritten -- handwritten -- handwritten letter from YouTube. I don't think you believe me; I'm gonna show you. Can you see? Can you see? It's hand written. It wasn't just a blanket, like, you know, pre printed card. Anyway, so quickly, before I lose -- um, sorry, for, yeah -- I know, I'm not comfortable either. Okay, you guys, you guys a little more comfortable?Um, I'm really tired, that's why I'm hyper by the way. Um, I get really talkative and ta -- talkative and hyper when I'm really sleepy. I barely got any sleep last night 'cause we bought XXXX a Mac. I converted him, yeah. And then, guess what else we got today -- guess what else? We got iPhones. We did. Um, his computer was paid for by um, the company he -- he works for so, no, we didn't go out and spend a shit ton on a new laptop. We don't have that kinda money.Um, but, uh, we -- we did buy iPhones because they're going to be essentially important, specially for me um, to get work done on the run, so I don't have to -- I don't have to be stuck at home anymore. Very cool, and then soon hopefully, they're going to be doing tethering which means I can use it uh, yeah, as internet for my computer.Okay, quickly, the last thing, oh my gosh. I'm -- I'm gonna run outta time. I think I can do a lot of minutes on this channel, I think. Let's hope. Um, the second thing -- the second thing? We're not on number two.The last thing. Last and far from least important, in fact the most important is October thirtieth at nine PM eastern standard time, I'm going to be live on Blog TV. Tell your friends. Tell everyone. I'm going to be live on Blog TV and I'm for two and a half hours, as long as there's enough questions to last that long, if no one shows up, then lonely little me will stick around for fifteen minutes and say bye bye to nobody. Um, but if you guys come by, you can say hi. Um, you guys can -- but, the main reason is for sex questions. So -","High","Low","High"
"VLOG122","﻿Hey, how's that? Okay, so I just finished telling how the story of my gender marker needing changed in court. I went to -- would you behave yourself? No, you're done. Are you done? Okay, so I take my signed order to the DMV to get my license changed, and I -- and I'm waiting in line and I'm, like, this could get fun.Of course, the most conservative, not so nice looking lady says, may I help the next person please? So, I go up and I give her the form I signed and filled out; and I'm, like, so okay, I don't need to renew my license, but I need to change my gender marker. And she just looks at me, like, huh? I said, I just got a court order; I just got my gender marker changed and need to change it; so I give her the order.She looks over it and says, I don't know if we can do this. I said, that order says that you have to. So, she's looking over it and she's, like, I just -- I don't know if we can do this. So, I read to her the part that says, it is ordered that all public offices change all documents blah, blah, blah to reflect the new gender, blah, blah, whatever, legal speak. I don't remember what the hell I wrote. And so, at this point she says, well, you know, I'm just not comfortable with this, I don't think I can do -- I'm not going to do this. So, I said, I need to speak to your manager.So, she -- me and then this other fantastically, pleasant looking individual comes up to me and she, like, says, what seems to be the problem? I said, well I got my gender marker changed this morning; and I asked her if she could change it for me; and she said that she doesn't feel it's ethically correct to do so. And so, I had to ask for you, and she looks at it and she's, like, well, you know, I just don't know how I feel about this; I don't think that I can do this either. And so, I grabbed the order and I said, this is a court signed order. It says it is ordered, and ordered is in bold print here. I didn't say that it was in bold print, but just looking at the document you can see its bold print. And so, I read it to her; she's, like, well I guess we have no choice, do we? I was, like, no, you don't. She tells the other lady, well go ahead and do it then.I love the way they get all shitty and snotty with me and print the thing out and hand it to me, and she's, like, here you go. And so, I signed it. She's, like, I need your left thumb print over here and your right thumb print over here and then she takes my picture. And I'm sure that I'm smiling, like, a fool in this picture.Because I mean not only did I just get my gender marker changed by myself, it kind of pleases me to force people to do things that they don't want to do in respect to this. I know it's wrong, but I can't help it.So, I get my, you know, paper ID. I have to wait, like, six to eight weeks for my photo ID. Yah.So, I -- you know, I stroll on over to Social Security Office and by stroll I mean get in my car and drive a mile or two and, you know, whatever. And so, the -- the lady called me, in Social Security and she was far more pleasant. She just asked for -- you know, I -- I told her what was up and I gave her the order and she was, like, okay, I need your ID. And so, I gave her my paper one and she was, like, do you have anything with the picture on? I said, here's my old one that still says female, and then she verified some information on me that they have. And she asked me if I need a new card and I say, no, because I still have my card; and it doesn't have a gender marker on it. She says, okay, have a nice day. And I'm, like, oh you too.So, I finished all that up and I'm super excited and then I had to go to work. Fail. But, yeah. So, I get off work and I go to a bar to celebrate with my friends. And they had all left, 'cause they all had big girl jobs and big boy jobs. So, I went to the bar tonight, because so more shit happened at work that's not so good, but that's for another story.So, yeah, I'm legally male. My driver's license and social is changed. I have to work out my passport and other such documentation, but yeah, life is good. And, I win. I'll catch you later. Bye.","High","High","High"
"VLOG123","Hey, YouTube. It's XXXX real name no gimmicks. How's it going people? Due to the success of the XXXX review review, which I thank everybody very much for watching, I'm going to do another computer game review. And today's computer game review I'm going to do today is XXXXNow I've got the limited hardened edition copy. XXXX, where can I begin now really? This game has got so much hype. It had so many commercials, trailers and even a little trailer .The hype of this game was tremendously huge. I could not believe it, it was just so unbelievable. It's a game here, like last year that was tremendously high. It was also the very first ever video game to receive a film premier style at London's Leicester Square which was absolutely amazing with this, it just shows how far computer games have become. And also not only that, on the first day of the UK launch it sold one point twenty three million copies, it's just -- it's unbelievable, it's absolutely fantastic. I'll tell you, it makes it the biggest selling computer game on its first day ever. It's just so unbelievable. It beat of for or five double.OK, enough about the hype and all the trailers and all the commercials I've been sort of talking about. Now let's talk about the game. Well, in this review, I'll also be showing you game play footage of me playing the game. All right, okay, so we're gonna do a bit of a crossfire against different enemies which is really cool.Okay, now for the story line, the main campaign load. It takes place five years after the original Call of Duty game. The marines and the UAS fought the other day, in action that beat the ultra nationalists in Russia. Unfortunately though, their sort of little plan had backfired. It turned out that Zakhaev, who was the main big bloke of the original XXXX game, was revered as a martyr and hero.When it came to Makarov , a former lieutenant of Zakhaev, decides to take over all of Europe and put out so many terrorist attacks all over across Europe, including Russia.At the very beginning of the game, I played Private Allen just to try to get used to the swing of things of the game. No, really you start off with training and then you go off to Afghanistan and go to Siberia. And then you head into Mother Russia as a CIA operative and this is where the controversy comes in.Politicians and the media have gotten involved with this particular level, level three, where you work as a CIA operative, join up with Makarov and shoot enough civilians at the local Russian air -To me, though, I found this level a little bit queasy because I found it quite in the big shock value, but I feel like the media and politicians have taken this level a little bit too far and only based it on judgment of hype about video clips of the airports that were being shown rather than playing that particular level as well.But one thing I do like with , just before you start the campaign mode you do get an option to actually skip that particular level or decide to play it. And then it -- once you get into that particular level and decide, oh this is a bit too queasy or a bit too harsh or a thing and that, you can actually skip that particular level. It's not with any other level as well. I like that little feature as well, it's kinda like really really cool.After the controversial level three, you will be playing as many other different soldiers that including Sergeant Roach who works for the task force one forty one.Okay, so we're now going to a mission in Brazil.Now enough about talking about the storyline, what about the game itself? I feel like there is a -- when I play in single player mode, it's a little bit too easy but it's kinda like really cool. The levels are really, really intense. There's loads and loads of action going on, especially from the very first level when you first start, it's absolutely fantastic. I love it, the graphics are so detailed.You get it in there, when you get shot, you saw I have blood going across the screen and that. It's really really quite cool. It's makes it so like really realistic as well. They put in a lot of details as well which is actually fantastic with the building size, the building.And it's got a lot of various different weapons, whether it's like a desert eagle, an A K forty seven, or rifle shotgun, or a sniper gun. And it's really, it's quite cool, you can pick up many, many different weapons along the way.To me I was thinking like, this is going to be like another first person sort of shoot out and it is sort of the way is. I mean, to me, I kinda have a dislike though for first person shooters. Some of them are really good but most of them are sorta like, Oh, they're just all the same, this sort of thing, like Far Cry Two. Like I was saying, I feel like the campaign mode doesn't add enough storyline and development sort of thing. I feel like it could be carried off a lot more better.There are a number of different locations you can travel across. I don't know -- there were a number of different locations with this game which makes this probably a real epic first person shoot out. Which includes from Afghanistan, Siberia, America, Brazil, and even going into a mission out into outer space in one particular point as well which I find really cool.I love the attention and detail, though of the Siberia level, when you're out climbing those mountains.I find it a bit of a struggle though, to climb those mountains at first, but after a little bit of time, I really got the hang of it which is really cool. You can drive a number of different vehicles, including the snowmobile, which I found really fun and enjoyable though on the second level.Now I haven't finished the campaign mode, but I have found it a little too easy though just to get sort of thing. They're very very small levels and it doesn't have too much depth to it. I think it was more focused on the graphics, though, and the voice acting. Speaking about the voice acting, I think it's absolutely superb. Yeah, news is better.There are two other different modes in this game. You have the special ops team where you have -- play different types of missions to gain stars sort of thing, where you need to do training, races, try to shoot people down, try to take out all kinds of guys. I think this is absolutely fantastic.You can play this on your own or play with a friend, though really as well. I think this is actually a really neat idea, it makes it really cool. And that's what brings in the fun sort of thing. I think this is one of those features that's a lot better though, than the main campaign mode.I did try to complete one of the special ops where I had to try and kill -- make thirty kills without killing more than six civilians, which I kept on failing all the time, but it's a nice little neat challenge. It makes you try and make and try and figure out which is the best option to go through to help to take out the entire gang. I think this is really good. The strategy in this game is absolutely brilliant. The AI is really really good.And the main reason that people have bought XXXX, yeah that's right, it's the multi player. With these death matches, it's like eight players, for everybody going at each other. It's really -- kinda like really fancy stuff. I've played it a couple of times, it is really good. The multiplayer is absolutely phenomenal. The nine on nine mode is actually is true, you can do it in teams. And there's also, yeah, you can have the individual free form, where you're -- it's for every man to themself. That's what I've been mainly been playing. I've really had a real kick out of it as well.I have had so much fun over it and I will be keep on playing the multiplayer as well. When you pick up points for the multiplayer, you can pick up new weapons, new perks, new equipment, which eventually in the near future, you'll be able to drop bombs over the enemies as well. I've had a few bombs dropped on me as well, and it's not a pleasant sight.I've been in the multiplayer mode with somebody; you can play on for hours and hours and hours. And the same there with the special ops, just to make yourself real -- really better though, really. I bet those are the two best modes, though, of the entire game.Okay, what about the negatives? I feel like the campaign mode's storyline isn't really juicy, isn't really sorta like really strong, as I thought it would be, but they do have a couple of twists and turns as well within the story. I'm hoping to really look forward to find out what these are.The pricing for the game, including this, I paid like seventy pounds, I think is a bit too much though really, but it does come with a nice couple of little goodies. Again, the price, again is a bit of a problem, like forty five pounds just for the game by itself, but I bet you they just want to be different from the rest of the market but other than that I've been seeing it's a bit pricey but it's still worth the money.So if you do want to buy XXXX, I think that you may want to play with a friend or play with a lot of people online though. It's just a really really good game on those special types of things.Okay, so I'm going give you like two different slightly ratings here. For the campaign single player mode, I'd probably give maybe three and a half. With the multiplayer with special ops I'm going to give four and three quarters. Yeah, I bet this is more of a game though that you want to play with your friends online.Overall, I give this game probably four and a quarter. Now I know some of you are going to think yeah, that's a bit of a controversial market -- thinking oh Barry, you should rate it five out of five. I don't know, I feel the campaign mode is a huge letdown.Okay, guys my next review is going to be the new XXXX and I hope you take care and I hoped you enjoyed my review of XXXX.Peace out.","High","High","High"
"VLOG124","I just woke -- hey YouTube, um, I -- I -- I can't actually tell you how drunk I was last night, I just -- I just, fuck, oh my God is right.

I don't what that's all about, but I always wake up and like the top of my packet's, like, fallen off.Oh, well, of course I'm attractive, this is me, beautiful, aren't I? Beautiful, oh, crap, okay, um, I'll try to say something vaguely interesting.All I can say, this offends me. Okay, I probably shouldn't really say that either. This is what our stupid England call a TV license. Hello, I'm a TV license , right, why do I have to pay -- let's see my letter.

I don't watch and I don't the X factor, which is on ITV, not fucking BBC so you can go stuff your fucking TV license.Well, I tried to say that I tried to stop the TV license, and some man came knocking on my door and said that if I didn't pay it then I'd get a thousand pounds fine, so I was like, what? So I paid it.But yeah, oh my God, I don't really get hangovers, but I can't tell you how drunk I was. I think I spent ninety fucking quid -- of course, that wasn't all on alcohol. Not that I was doing anything wrong.Anyway, I had waffles a little bit now, uh yeah, I just thought everyone should see the beauty that is me after a night out. Just in case anyone wants to sleep with me, and then this is what you'd be waking up next to, not pretty, no, not even a little bit. Not even a smidgen, so anyway, I hope you all have a lovely day and I'm going to practice again Monday morning, because I'm going out Sunday night, to get I'm going to forget about all bills.

Um, I have bronchitis, actually, which was, like, devilish and I've never had it before and I never wish to get it again, so.Anyway, I had purchased, um, some false lashes from China on eBay about a month ago, and I was, like, oh great, I totally got scammed. So, like, I hadn't gotten them, but today they came in and I absolutely love them.They were super cheap. I got, um; I got ten of these for, like, a dollar. Um, and then I got forty pairs of lashes that come in, like, a big box like this -- wait a second a bit -- of these. I got those for I think, like, two dollars. Forty pairs of lashes for, like, two dollars. And shipping wasn't that expensive either. It was only, like, three bucks for it -- it to -- it to take, like, a month to get here, but nevertheless, um, I love them.But, I have a ton and I know I'm not going to go through them all -- actually um, there's two styles. I mean, they're great quality and I do love them, but there are two styles that I know, like, I'm never ever gonna use. I wear really big, thick, um, like, drag queen lashes at all times. Um, so these -- in these -- let me see 'em -- are not going to cut it for me. They would for, like, ninety five percent of the population. These are, like, everyday lashes, that a lot of people love, but I know I'm never ever gonna wear them.So, I'm gonna give them away to you. Uh, two people will get these. Um, just comment below. Type enter me and I will pick the winner -- when will I pick the winner? I will -- the contest will end in -- we'll say a week? I'll post whenever it's gonna end, um, in the side bar, because I'm really indecisive right now. Um, so yeah. Just hit enter me and that will enter you in to win, um, one of these boxes of lashes. There's ten sets in here; ten pairs of lashes. Um, so yeah, they're really great, great quality. Um, I'm really impressed with them. I'm going to link you also to the eBay store that I bought these from because literally, like, forty lashes for a dollar is incredible.So, let me just show you. When you put them in a box like this, you just pop them out and -- let me see if I can get this out -- and there's going to be -- do you see the end? You're just going to have to trim this little bit off and then you'll put them on like normal. So, um, don't get confused when there's, um, the lash band kind of extends over the actual lashes -- do you -- all you have to do is just trim that off and put them right back on. The lash band is super, super, um, like, pliable and easy to work with.Um, I'm actually wearing some of them right now. I love them. I definitely recommend them if you're a big lash wearer like I am. I wear fake lashes every single day and it gets really expensive. So, I can buy, like, a whole box of lashes like this for, like, five bucks, that's excellent.Um, so, I'll put the link up into the side bar.

"VLOG13","Hello, so I'm -- keep looking at myself.

I thought that was pretty cool that she did that and um, let's see. I love how it looks really good quality right there but I'm pretty sure as soon as I upload it, it's gonna look all gritty. Um, just gonna go for it. Um, hmm, uh, yeah okay, back to the video. I'm just trying to collect my thoughts.Um, I just -- I just saw it like maybe five seconds ago. Seriously, like five seconds ago I saw it and I was -- I just had to make a video and tell you that I thought it was actually pretty good and I didn't really understand the concepts. She was like a vampire prostitute, who was being sold off to the highest bidder, and then she kills him at the end by setting him on fire? Is that the concept or is that what the plot of it is? Is that the synapsis, synopsis, synopses?Um, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm really bored. I didn't go to school today 'cause I didn't feel good and um, Twitter was all Lady Gaga, Bad Romance, so the video just premiered like, today, so I -- well, on YouTube at least, I've never seen it on TV. Then again, do they really play videos on TV anymore? Not really.But, um, overall I thought the music was really good. Um, Lady Gaga doesn't really have that great of a range, in my opinion, but I thought she did some really interesting things with her voice, like a whole, part, I thought that was pretty cool. But um, yeah.I don't know, just overall I thought it was pretty interesting. I don't want to say like its amazing or anything, but I don't want to say it's terrible, I just think it's pretty interesting. And um, that's all .","Low","High","High"

And on the label it says, this T shirt was tested on animals -- it didn't fit. Which is funny, and strange, and weird like that.Okay. And news about my life. I've been reading this book, Brigands MC, Robert Muchamore. And it's in the series of CHERUB. You can see that there. It's the eleventh one, I think, so it's really good.

If you're -- if you're a girl and you like it just, like, say it or anything. You should read it anyway if you haven't and if you have good for you.And, uh, I downloaded this new editing software and I can't understand it. It's called t at b Z S four, and it's really confusing -- I don't get it. There's a link in the sidebar there and it takes thirty seconds to download and then, like, a minute to install. But I don't understand it at all. If anyone can, like, give me a link to a website that tells you how to do it or anything. Now I'm just using Windows Movie Maker because I used to use Sony Vegas Pro, the trial, and then someone said you can download it again but it doesn't work for me. I don't know how you do it. Do you have to like -- I turned off cookies, if that makes a difference. But, I mean, it's just the same. And, yeah, well, if you -- and I -- I don't really wanna buy the real thing because it's five hundred pounds. So that's a bit expensive for editing software I'm gonna use, like, once a week. Well, actually at the moment it's twice a week. So -- and -Okay, now it's a time when I might get a bit, like, sound a bit nerdy. So if you don't wanna hear anything about this, turn off now and thanks for the view. And, um, so, uh, I -- we just bought HALO: ODST yesterday and it's really good, even though it has no multi player. It has that five point mode which is really good, I think. But, um, yeah, it's really good and I was looking online and preordered Modern Warfare Two. I have game tags in the sidebar, if you wanna look at that. Add me or send me a message or anything or something like that. I'm on Xbox, not PS Three. I just don't like PS Three. It's not as good, I don't think.

It's like, just an extra, whatever it is, like 4 pounds -- 3 pounds a month or something. It's okay. So, whatever.

"VLOG131","Hi there. Um, it's been a while. Yeah, um, I haven't been around for a long time as you can probably tell. Um, my last video was about two weeks, so um, I just want to let everyone to know I'm still -- I'm still here. I'm still around so don't get any ideas that I'm -- I'm gone which I haven't.Um, well I can actually um, explain the reasons why I haven't been around. Um, probably one of the main reasons is because I have been suffering from a bad cold which is a bit annoying and obviously I don't want to make videos while I'm a bit poorly, so, um, I had to leave for a couple of weeks. Uh, so, it's probably a reason why I haven't been around lately.Um, of course, uh, I posted up the um, the top ten Chelsea goals um, yesterday uh, which I wanted to do because um, because I was just literally watching um, primary league videos um, for a couple of days. It just gave me a bit of uh, interesting thing to -- do something like that so. Um, I've gotten a couple of comments so um.Another thing. Uh, I've got 200 subscribers which is really good. Um, I'm actually quite flattered that I've got two hundred subscribers now and so yeah. I've come a long way. I've come a long, long way. It's um, I'm quite pleased about that. Uh, so I'm, yeah. I'm -- I'm really flattered.Everyone writes on my Swedish lesson videos and think I get a lot of comments about that. My first -- my first Swedish lesson has gotten loads and loads of comments and viewers and I'm really, I'm quite flattered about that. So thank you very, very much for commenting and thank you very much for uh, your views and your um, ratings. So keep commenting and rating those videos and I hope you get a lot of use out of them. Uh, I hope there'll be a new one coming very soon if I'm still alive. If I'm still -- if I'm still good.Um, I have one more question that I need to ask, and that's the Becker thing. Um, yeah, um, basically I wanted to ask you something. Um, if you -- if you could make a video about it that would be even better. Um, I was wondering if you -- if you knew any ornaments, any Swedish ornaments um, I've got one right here. You probably already know what this is if you can actually see it. I'm not sure, but whatever. This is a balicarian horse. It's obviously a very Swedish horse and I bought it when I was in Stockholm last year. Um, I bought it for a hundred forty nine Swedish Kroner I think. Um, and it's been sitting over there on my desk with the Swedish flag on top of it. Um, it's my sort of little -- little Swedish shrine box.I want to ask Becker if she knows any other ornaments that are collectable from Sweden um, because I -- I really like the Swedish ornaments. Um, so if you could make a video about it that would be fantastic. Um, but um, normally -- but you're -- going videos I think. Um, a lot of other things, so it will be difficult for you to get a chance to but um, no worries and just do it when you get a chance and um, yeah.So that's all I need to say, um, because I haven't been here in a while and um, and I need to update you guys on everything that has been going on. So um, there will be a couple of videos from me soon. Um, I am still around. I am not gone um, just that I have been suffering from a cold lately and it's a bit shit.

"VLOG133","Yup, yup tomorrow I hit the quarter century mark. Let's move on -- Knight Life by Peter David. The first you might want to know about Knight Life is that as you might have been able to tell from the cover picture, it is Arthurian legend, but it is not for Arthurian legend purists. Peter David, the author, looked at several Arthurian legend books including Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Mallory, The Once and Future King and The Book of Merlyn by T. H. White, The Last Enchantment and other assorted titles by Mary Stewart and he says in the forward all of the above have been carefully read or purchased or checked out from the local library and never returned by the author of this work . In the preparation of this manuscript, the author has at the very least, skimmed the flap copies, sell copy and table of contents of all of the above, plus many other titles too numerous or obscure to mention. So while there are a lot of things that ring true with Arthurian legend, there are also a lot of inaccuracies.But the point of this novel is not to be accurate to the nth degree with the Arthurian legend. The point of this novel is to make you laugh. So if you're an Arthurian legend purist, I would either recommend that you not read this book or that you do read this book and chill a little bit. Thanks. So this book basically asks the question what if King Arthur were to return from Avalon or his healing place today and therefore would be subject to the modern political system. That is essentially what happens in this book. Arthur returns and is found wandering around 20th century New York City wearing a suit of armor. And Arthur soon realizes that this new society and this new political system is not merely going to accept him as king, just because he says he is.And so he begins his rise back to power by running for mayor of New York City. So, already it's hilarious -- King Arthur is running for mayor of New York City. Yeah, so he's not alone in his endeavor to run for mayor of New York City. His campaign manager is of course, good ol' Merlin. Unfortunately, at the moment Merlin is in the guise of an eight year old boy because in order to stay immortal, Merlin has made it so that he actually ages backwards. Arthur also has his personal assistant, Gwen, who looks alarmingly like somebody he used to know -- and of course Percival, the immortal Grail knight . But it's not just the good guys that have come back. Uh, Morgan le Fay is still around and causing mischief along with Arthur's bastard son Mordred who is actually the campaign manager for the other guy.So the book watches Arthur as he struggles to understand this new society and this new political system and most especially these people. The people of the twentieth century are so vastly different from the people of Arthur's time, largely because of their just general apathy. And Arthur is appalled by this apathy in the people who are voting for their leaders and so he tries to instill some passion and some caring in them. See basically, Arthur is that candidate, that crazy independent candidate who runs for office, not with any expectation of winning, but just to get his views out there and to hold the other candidates accountable. The only difference is that Arthur has every intention of winning and in fact, has a pretty decent of doing so. His views are extremely antiquated and yet they resonate with an alarming number of people and a lot of people flock over to his side. And soon he is a major contender for the mayor of New York City. So much so, that Morgan le Fay and Mordred have to put a stop to it.Obviously this book is a comedy and it makes fun of a lot of different things, uh, including New Yorkers, the Media, New Yorkers, the American political system, New Yorkers, politicians. Uh, did I mention New Yorkers? Of course we see Arthur being incredibly naïve about this new world that he finds himself in. But through all the comedy there's also a lot of good messages in this book. In fact, a lot of the messages are the same messages as the Arthurian legend. One of the things that I like about the character of Arthur is that I don't always agree with him. But the point that Arthur makes is that it is not his purpose to make people agree with him -- it's to make people think. It's to get people out of that apathetic state that they found themselves in and make them think about the issues and about why they elect the people that they elect. He recognizes that the power of leadership does not really lie with the leaders, but the people that support those leaders.One of the fun things about this book is that every so often, in between chapters, you'll have ye old sound bite which is something which is essentially from the television or radio -- a news report or a commercial, or something along those lines, which both makes fun of the media and also just shows how much of an influence the media really has. Peter David, incidentally, is much kinder to the media than say, Dan Brown is. So I enjoyed this book every bit as much on the reread as I did the first time that I read it. There is a sequel which is about the search for the Holy Grail, but I haven't actually read that one yet. I'm hoping to actually read it now. But Knight Life by Peter David is still a favorite and I would highly recommend to each of you that you read it, especially if you're a fan of the Arthurian legend.The next book in the favorite series is going to be Paper Towns by John Greene, but you're gonna have to wait a little bit before you see it. I'm taking a brief -- and by brief I mean like two weeks -- a brief hiatus from this project -- largely because by my own rules of the project, I can't reread a book until it's been at least a year since I last read it. And so I'm going to be waiting until about October eighteenth before I start reading Paper Towns. And I probably could fit in another couple of books in between there, but I've decided to do a little catching up on my regular reading which has kinda fallen by the wayside. And so, that's that. And the next time you see me I will be twenty five years old. Oh my God! 'til then - see you next time.","High","High","High"

I guess a couple of months ago, XXXX and I decided that we were really interested in the possibility of getting a real life, online video conference in order to get all of the best online video creators together in the same place, and the communities that support those groups in order to get like, uh, uh, an entire epic, gigantic weekend of fun and growing the community and doing awesome things.That's your big news?Yeah. That -- that's my -- I mean, the news is that we're actually gonna do it and it's gonna be this summer in Los Angeles from July ninth to July eleventh.Your big news is that a bunch of you and your nerdy friends are gonna get together and drink Juicy Juices and hang out and talk about nerdy stuff?Well -- I mean, XXXX I don't think that you understand that online video is is like, a really huge deal.Well I got ingrown toenail that's a really huge deal but I'm not making a conference about it.Um, I'm having a really hard time figuring out how you could have an ingrown toenail.Well, yeah. It's complicated.Anyway, online video is an entirely new medium it's creating new genres and really active, engaged, and a large communities of people. Believe it or not, there are probably going be, like, a hundred thousand people watching this video that we're making right now.Hmm? Out of my hair!Um, your hair is surprisingly sparkly. I never noticed that your hair was sparkly.Yeah, I use product. What?Nothing, don't worry about it.So who's gonna be there?Uh, well, a lot of people are gonna be there. People from XXXX all the way from XXXX, like, to XXXX, but also people from all over the world of online video. We've got Michael Buckley , Dave Dayes , Jay Carl , Brittney Louis Taylor , Ray William Johnson , David Choy , Redin Link , Mitchell Davis , me, my brother, Julian Noons , Natalie Tran -- I can't believe we have freaking Natalie Tran! Shane Dawson -Shane Dawson?Yeah, Shane Dawson!I love that guy!Yeah I know, I love him, too!Feel better, Shane!The success of these of these projects isn't based on, like, million dollar marketing budgets or or the ungodly beauty of the people who started them.Well, that's for sure.Yeah, thanks. It's based on what I think is the raw ability to entertain, and people who are able to bring people into the communities so that they watch every new video that gets put up -- not just when they light their face on fire or capture a particularly adorable cat moment.God, I love that cat.Yeah, I know, I love that cat too. But the cat's not gonna be there -- we couldn't get the cat for the conference. But there are going to be many of the most successful people in online video and that list that I gave you earlier isn't even a complete list and we're gonna have demonstrations and we're gonna have talks and performances by these people. We're gonna have concerts and dance parties and we're gonna have all kinds of crazy things that we can't even think of yet and we're gonna ask the community to present ideas for us -Like karaoke?Karaoke is a very good idea. Thank you, that's an excellent idea.I want a ball pit.A ball pit? Yes, a ball pit is another great idea. Do you have other ideas?What about a booth where Charlie McDonough sits and he bites people's fingers so they can say, ouch, ouch, Charlie.I will talk to Charlie about that. There's gonna be an insider track that's gonna be basically for people who are really into YouTube and wanna, like, get down on the down and dirty specifics of creating a community on YouTube and the business and and the future of YouTube. It is gonna cost money -- it's -- the registration is going to cost money because these things cost a lot of money to put on. If you wanna find out more, there's lots more information on the website which is at vidcon twenty ten dot com, and you can check out our Twitter feed at twitter. com/vidcon, and our YouTube channel of course youtube. com/vidcon. I think that's all I wanted to talk about. XXXX, XXXX, we'll see you at VidCon.","High","High","High"
"VLOG136","﻿What's up, you guys? Um, normally I would post two videos in the same day, but I feel, like, what I have to say is extremely important enough for me to do so.So um, I was just presented with a situation, and before I even start this, this is going straight to the person who caused me to actually want to make a video about it, because I realized that whenever someone is not sure about something or kind of in the blind, or in the dark about a situation, they come off sounding more stupid than they really are. So, it's no shame, um, even if they comment -- anyway.Okay, a girl added me today on MySpace and I had this thing on my page where you can contact me via MyS -- I mean via Yahoo, and she aksed me was I gay, right off the bat. She asked me if I was bisexual, to be more correct about the situation. And I was, like, no I'm gay. She paid it and she was, like, well it's been -- what it was, like, while it lasted blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.And you know, being gay, you gonna -- you expect stuff like that, so I really paid it 'cause I'm not interested in you anyway. So girl, it -- it doesn't matter to me. Um, but then she came back, here recent -- just a while ago. And she was, like, uh, I don't mean to bother you but I just wanted to know if being gay come natural or was there a error that had been -- while you were growing up.Now, I'm -- I -- I'll answer that question on almost -- of occasion, but it just pisses me off that every time someone brings up a situation about someone being gay, it's always talked to some kind of negative aspect in a person's life. Like, how the hell -- I mean not how, but why the hell does being gay have to be tied to so many negative feeling? Actually being straight isn't all a walk in the park either.Um, being part of a community and then being part of a sub community: one me being a African American male, and then two for me being a homosexual African American male, it kinda puts me in a tough position because I really want to act immaturely and go off whenever I -- I receive statements like that, but honestly, I think that the best way to prove a point to someone is just to continue doing yourself, and do it maturely.Um, it's obvious and that it was just made clear to me that there's a lot of people in the dark about being homosexual. But, um, and it kind -- the conversation ended up stopping because she didn't like one of my -- my answers and honestly I didn't even go off on the girl, but I -- I don't know.Barak Obama isn't the only one who can inspire change, and I'm definitely gonna start making my walk about change, because if a person -- if this, people are still left in the dark about being a homosexual, what homosexual people go through or how its come about, then obviously we need to do more as a whole to give that situation -- talk about and discuss more thoroughly.Man, this pr -- this video probably won't even hit home to a lot of people, specially to those who don't put much thought into -- into it. But I just feel like I needed to, um, say my little spill on it, and there's so much more that I could say about it, but I'm not even gonna waste anyone's time.Tomorrow is a day of thanks, and we should all be blessed and thankful that we are alive, breathing and kicking -- some of us well, but some of not. But we're still here making it and struggling. So, I don't know. I'm just gonna be thankful for that, and I'm going to definitely create a video tomorrow to which I'll leak after Happy Thanksgiving even though I probably get into many of you already, but um, still, just because. But, y'all be careful and y'all take care. And just, uh, discuss -- discuss the things that people aren't necessarily discussing.Be different. Make a change. Peace.","High","High","High"
"VLOG137","﻿Hi, everyone. My brain is gone; I just want to throw that out there first, because, oh my gosh, I'm so tired. I've been really bad on my diet too, oh my gosh, eating everything in the world, um, but I was up yesterday at four AM to be at work by six and then I was up at three this morning to be at work by five. I'm very tired. It's only eight thirty right now, in the evening and I'm ready to fall asleep.Anyway, um, let's get on with this. Um, Josh, thanks for the shout out that makes me so happy, like makes my day, when I get a shout out. Em, you're about the only one I talk to out here, so yay. How do you, like, get more into the screen than me? Am I just like that big or is it my camera, or is it the layout? I need to stop watching myself. Okay, anyway, um, I've been doing a lot of nothing. Going to school, back in school, taking a -- excuse me, my nose is congested. I'm taking interpreting -- no, I'm not, I lied. I'm taking sign language one and English one hundred, 'cause I'm lame and I can't write an essay to save my life so, I'm working on that. Um, and those are the only two classes and I work five days a week, I go to school two days a week and I have no days off, it's really fun. Thursday's in the afternoon. Um, I've been talking to Josh a lot online which is pretty awesome. I still have the package I was supposed to send you guys, ah, in my closet; I'm looking at it right there, so, um, come out to California, 'cause I have no money and I can't send it, so and 'cause it's -- yeah, it was themed, but the theme can't go on, but the show must go on.Uh, I was just sitting here watching my cat play with this, like, you know, plastic, like, tag things that are on your clothes that keep the tags on, she's playing with that and it's really adorable, that's not interesting at all.Dating life is going somewhat okay. I feel like I'm breathing all over the mike, I'm sorry if I am. Um, I haven't met -- well I've met one guy and he's really cool, but really flaky. Every time we try to hang out something happens and we can't, so I'm over it. Nice guy, though. And then there's this other guy who lives in Oceanside and I hope he doesn't watch these videos, 'cause I'm just going to talk about him, but basically, he, uh, is really awesome. I don't know if he's what I want in a boyfriend, but very cool guy. Makes me feel good. Um, he says I'm gorgeous; don't think I can trust that. And Josh ran away near Brittany Spears, Jesus Pirate pumpkin, Steve Tyler freaking awesome, better than any pumpkin I can do. I love carving pumpkins, but I don't, um, I don't know. My hair, my goodness, this is terrible, that's cute, so bad whatever, it's just YouTube. Oh, I'm so tired.Um, what else? I have a lot of things I need to do. I've got tons of time to do them, but I've been procrastinating everything, it's really, really bad. Really bad.Um, I like my fan, it's pretty cool, you can see it, maybe put decorations on it or something. That's a good idea, I'll put like, a different image on the fan, 'cause I'm really good at editing and I'll -- and edit an image onto the fan. It'll be taped. Why can't I edit videos? Josh come to California and teach me how to edit -- edit videos. Just annoying whining.Um, I feel like there's so much more we need to talk about. Josh, you are green, honey, and look -- look what I have it's honey and it's green. there it is. Ooo, this one's got a zipper, so it can be all cozy inside, see? Grrrr. That's just how I'm going to do all my videos from now on, 'cause I am the green hoodie guild knight of the round -- of the square desk, of the laptop. Don't ask me why. This is also why I don't drink, because I don't need alcohol to go insane. Oh my god, I'm so tired. Um, there was a lot more, I don't remember what I was going to talk about, just want some guy who lives very far away, but ah, no, I won't. embarrass Josh, but there's a certain guy that I want, that I mentioned before, that needs to come to California and marry me, okay? Not going to say who it is, because I don't want him to think I'm insane. 'Cause I got featured on this video. Okay, that's enough. I don't know. Okay, I guess I will talk to everyone later, um, I think I've rambled long enough. I hope it's not too long and I will talk to you. Seven minutes, oh my, I'm so sorry. Okay. Bye.

"VLOG140","Hey, it's still Monday and this is my first official XXXX video. Now you might ask, what is a XXXX? Well this is a XXXX. Do you understand now? It's a wall covered in Post its. But each Post it contains a tinny amount of awesome. And it's just amazing. Basically I live in the coolest dorm ever and whenever something amazing goes down or we have a new inside joke or something just amazing happens I write it on a Post it and I date it and I tape it to the Post it wall. And so everyday I am going to be explaining a Post it to you. Today's Post it is this one.I'm a really a big fan of the snap pictures jump cut thing. But anyway that Post it said I like to think of Jesus as a mischievous badger. Ten points if you know where the quote came from but, it's not really about where the quote came from. Basically we became addicted to this website called MLIA, its mylifeisaverage. com and it really should be my life is awesome because it's just all these stories about cool stuff that happened in people's lives. And it's better than fuck my life because instead of laughing at people's sadness you're laughing at people's awesome.Anyway a lot of them are about the Google game which is, like, where you put in a phrase and then you see what pops up first. You know, like, I think I like -- I blah or whatever -- and whatever comes up first is just usually hilarious. And so we put in, I like to think of and up came Jesus as a mischievous badger. And so that is the official first Post it on the Post it wall. That is where the Post it wall idea came from and it is super fun.Tomorrow I will be telling you about the second Post it on the XXXX and then the next day I will be telling you about the third. It's just really cool and it's -- a lot of you know you wouldn't get it if you weren't there stories, but you know what? They're still awesome and they'll still make you laugh. So tune in. And that's my first Post it wall video. I like it.I'm playing with my flat bracelet. I found it on our counter and I was, like, what the fuck? I'm going to steal Weasy Waiters flat bracelet idea as I did in the first video today. And now I'm playing with it because it makes fun noises. I like it.

"VLOG141","Hey. What's up everybody. This is XXXX, Super thick mommy. Um, this is just a shout out video. The reason why I'm doing this video is because yesterday I reached forty thousand plus friends on MySpace, um, and I was super excited about that and very happy. It might be 'cause I have forty thousand friends. I mean, yeah, okay its cool I got forty thousand friends. But the fact that people are showing me love and, you know, appreciate what I do. Um, and the more people I get to get involved in the movement and, you know, follow my YouTube videos and, um, basically understand. Sorry about that. . Just basically understand that the reason why I'm doing this, yes I love modeling. Yes I love to take pictures. Yes, yes, yes, yes, I love it all. But I also love it when I get a message from another big girl who tells me, um, they look up to me and that they appreciate what I do for them, and, you know, that I'm an inspiration to them. That right there makes my day. The fact that somebody tells me that, that I can do that difference in their lives, wow. That's for me -- that for me right now is overwhelming. Just because I was at their spot in their shoes just about two years ago. And the fact that I can help another big girl appreciate herself and make herself feel good. That tops a lot right there. So that's why I do this video. I want to thank everybody for showing me love and for being there and -- like every step of the way. So, it's -- it's super exciting and, um, I'm just going to be doing more blogs, yeah, not video blogs, not vlogs. I saw people putting that on MySpace so now I know that they're called vlogs, there you go. So that's it. That's why I wanted to do this little thank you video, and, uh, just so that you guys know that I do appreciate every single comment, every photo comment, every message. And I'm, I'm super excited woah. I also wanted to basically say hi to all the big girls. Say hi to my girl, uh, Pantera. I love you girl, you're like, um, seriously, um, you're something else but I really do love you a lot. But -- so she's my girl. Check her out, she's on my number one spot on MySpace and check out her website, queensizedelight. com, um, and just everybody that's been there supporting me from day one. So, um, just I love you. Um, just, there are so many people who I don't even like, Dee Good who wrote and sang my song called Super Thick. Um, he's on my top spot too, check him out.

"VLOG143","﻿Hi, and welcome back to my video blog. This is a new series that I want to start called, uh, the XXXX. Um, I love ya. Um, I've -- I discussed with some people about the title and some of you have said that being an atheist doesn't really change who you are and that is true. I'm not an atheist. Atheist is not a label you can put on someone. Besides, it's a lack -- uh, it's not a lack of belief -- it's a non belief in God or gods, uh, which doesn't tell anything else other than that. But by saying that, this is because a lot of religious people out there -- a lot I personally as well have met -- have said that atheists are amoral, uh, have bad ethics, uh, and all in all are bad people.So now we're going to take this from the perspective of a parent and talk about what it is to be a parent. Uh, you didn't hear me ask me any questions irreligious or regarding parenting for -- for this series.Uh, I am a father to a boy that is two years old now. Uh, he was born in two thousand seven. I'm twenty three years old, so I was, uh, twenty one when he was born. Uh, some -- some would call that a young parent -- I don't really regard myself as being young, but I know that I'm young in the sense that I'm not old. Uh, but I'm not so young that I can't take responsibility, uh, by, uh, responsibility -- responsibility for the upbringing of a child and be there as a parent for him. Um, so yeah.Sorry, I'm still a bit sick. My son is at his mother's place. We broke up, uh, a while ago, you can look back in my video blogs to figure out when it is. Uh, we're still communicating as friends and we -- we switch with him, having him a week each, and this is my week off, um, because I've got work this weekend. I can't really have a boy of two years old running around at home alone while Daddy is at work.Um, but anyway. How does being atheist come in, uh, when it comes -- regard -- when it comes to parenting? Um, I don't really think that it comes down -- uh, it doesn't really affect the child as much, uh, besides the fact that I think religious people are trying to push their dogma and belief onto their children -- basically brainwashing them or indoctrinating.Um, you could say the same thing about politics. Uh, I would never push, uh, my political views onto my son. Uh, I don't think that would be possible because my ex girlfriend, uh, is on the other political -- well, she's not the same political view as I do. I'm very liberal -- uh, yeah, liberal socialist. Anyway, uh, but being an atheist doesn't mean you have bad moral or a total lack of moral or no morals at all or no ethics. Uh, morals are basically -- there are a lot of videos explaining why you can have a moral without believing in God. God's not necessary for there to be moral. Uh, morality, uh, simplified, is basically, uh, social, uh, decisions with social interactions. Uh, I think fifty four talked about it in one of their videos. That morality be bumped.Uh, what I want to teach my child is respect for other people. Respect to people regardless of their age, ethnicity, race, political views, or religious views.

I don't know how you got them, but I haven't been able to move from this seat for three days and my butt is starting to get very, very chapped.So, send those back at any time. I would really appreciate it, so that I can get up and eat, which is my favorite thing to do.PS -- that means post script by the way, did you know that? Congratulations to Château of a Doubt for reaching fifty subscribers.Much love from me to you. This is getting creepy. I'll stop now. I'm just going to go.﻿Okay, XXXX, let's see how many women you can take off today, yeah. That's my life goal right there. To be a woman, you have to be caring and loving and a little unforgiving. Please don't hurt me.Think that men are pigs, because if you don't, then you will be seen as a traitor to your own gender, apparently. I'm pretty sure someone is going to shank me down in the night for saying that. If you're a person of my age, then when you were little you have to have gone to a slumber party where you dressed up as one of the Spice Girls. I know all of you have done that, don't even lie to me. You have to have gone through a phase when you were little that you just thought makeup was the greatest thing ever invented and that you needed it. Love chocolate, it is your best friend. It will heal the sick and cure blindness. Be self critical. No matter how good you look, always turn to someone and ask, does this make me look fat?Okay, now I feel that I have ticked enough of you that I can turn Twitter and avoid being shanked down in the middle of the night. So, here are what the people on Twitter have to say about being a girl. Beef Muffin Hippo says that you have to look at yourself in every reflective surface you see, because, I don't know, you think you have cheeseburger stuck on your face.Ellie says that you have to be interested in makeup, be a good cook, and please remember I am not saying this next part, but you can't drive. You're not good at driving.According to Teen Lee, you can never go anywhere alone, even the bathroom, which is disgusting and disturbed and I kinda don't want to hang out with any women, ever again.And Justo says you have to have celebrity crushes.And according to Kate, those would probably the Jonas Brothers, or Twilight characters, or someone from HSM which I'm guessing is High School Musical because I am the bomb at guessing acronyms.Emily says that you have to think that everyone is prettier and better dressed than you, and feel self conscious.Michelle says you're good at makeup, you're good a fashion, you have a lot of drama and emotion, you like to shop, and you like men. I'm a man. Do you like me? You probably don't like me, I'm sorry.publishing tie, yeah.On the last video, I made a giant mistake that I'm going to apologize for. I asked something that you couldn't stand about the opposite gender. Big mistake on my part. Sorry about all the comments.So instead, on this one I'm going to ask for an acronym for Obama. And no, nothing political. Obama just popped into my head for some reason. Old beavers always mall actors. Because they don't like actors, apparently.Despite how some of the comments were utterly sexist, I am going to show some comments that I found hilarious. Please do not shank me in my sleep for showing them.I thank you.","High","High","High"
"VLOG145","﻿Okay, so I'm trying something new. I don't know if anybody is going to walk in honestly. They're all asleep, I think. is not here anymore, so I'm like looking around the camera at myself in the mirror. That's very weird.Obviously . I'm doing this video because I just put up a post -- I think last night -- on my blog which I will link in the sidebar, about we used two makeup removers. Now I'm not trying to be over news, because I suck at things like that, and that's much left to Irene; but this is my favorite makeup remover, and each of you know well makeup remover and as you can see I have not so much., whirl win, um. I have not so much money right now, so I had to go looking for one and I found the great eye makeup in the world and I'm turning in all different directions because I'm trying to watch to see what I'm doing in the shadows. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to spill oil free makeup on my left side with Neutrogena One, and I'm going to do the equate on this eye, and I'm going to compare them.Right; cotton pad, equateNow make sure you get it in this bottle because the other bottle, the weird bottle, I don't know. If I can find a picture of it, I'll put it upNow, I'm not going to take all of it off; I'm -- we're going to do a test. I've got UDPP, a Cover Girl eye shadow Mac eye shadow; a Milani liner; a mixing medium brow pencil; I got all that.So what we're going to do is -- I can't do -- I hate this camera, I can't zoom with the camera so I have to like come like this. So, one swipe. I'm going to put it on and I'm going to hold it there for a couple of seconds. I'm just going to wipe. I don't even care if there's like residue. That is one swipe.Apparently, both my camera batteries are dead, and so I'm going to try to do this real fast, so that was one swipe with the equate one. So here is another cotton pad, Neutrogena, dumping it all over myself. Hold it for a few seconds.So, actually I can tell right now that it is no difference from the way they take the makeup off. Well, one swipe each, it's just as good as the equate, it's just as good as the Neutrogena in my opinion, and now I'm going to shut this camera off, go and charge the batteries, and take this stuff off.

"VLOG146","﻿Hey, do you want a chocolate cupcake? Seriously, do you? Ahh. So hey guys, it's blog time again. You haven't had a blog in a while, have you? Well, here's one now.Quick question, though. Has anyone ever had a spot on their butt that just won't go away? It's annoying, isn't it?So basically, this is just a little clip -- why can't I talk? Seriously, why? Well, enough about me, what have you guys been up to? I want to know everything. Like everything, did you have a shower today or a bath? What shampoo did you use? Herbal Essences? Oh yeah.Okay, I really don't care that much about what you've been up to. This is just to let you know that I have, uh, quite a few videos in the making. Um, I'm sorry I've been a bit dead over the past couple of weeks. Among other things, it's Halloween, um, but yeah, I've been fairly busy with college et cetera. College is going well. 'Cause we've been putting to bands and stuff, uh, like little college bands today -- like half an hour cover set for a game they're playing at Christmas. If any of you live around the Oxford area, um, you can come see me play on the eighteenth of December, at the Oxford and Cherwell Valley College. If you want -- if you want details of it, you could send me a message on YouTube and I'll be happy to reply.Do you like my makeshift mike stand? Hello, hello.So I've got two more things to talk about. One is a little bit of I'm going to do. One of my friends is an amazing pianist, like seriously amazing. I have two friends that are amazing pianists. I'd say both of them -- the first one is my friend Simon. If you've been on my channel recently or you follow me on Twitter, you may have noticed that I put up a -- pigeonal go go of exposure poo, a legend on the piano medley that he did. It's really good, really nice to listen to and he's just -- he's just an amazing pianist. Did I mention he's an amazing pianist? If you say pianist five times very fast, it ends up sounding like penis. Pianist, pianist, pianist, pianist, pianist. Ahh seriously, I've just realized that. I'm a genius.But seriously, go check in the sidebar for that. Rate it comment on it, 'cause it's an amazing medley, like really, yeah. And the other user is DarkMoonCoversNineteen, um the -- there should be a little uh, annotation that appears on the screen. Oh, there is. The fact is what is putting in the sidebar, why don't we just throw the link up to the other video, which is there. You see it? You see it? And poof it's gone. And so is the other one, poof. Um, I'm weird aren't I? Yeah, you are a bit. Well, there's no need to be like that. Anyway, and the second thing. I have been recording a song -- a song, you know, like a song, song that I wrote. So I'm gonna be like, the next Dave from Blue Skies. Ha, ha, ha, no obviously not. But here's a small little clip of the rough mix now. That'll do. So the final mix of that song, along with the music video should be up this weekend or the beginning of next week, so something for you to look forward to. Me singing and playing guitar. Whoo. Suck it XXXX.","High","High","Low"

I'm not going to read them 'cause it's all like -- I can't read the handwriting anyway, and it's a whole bunch of cards from like, oh I'm glad you had a baby girl. Um, I used to be really big on me -﻿Um, hey YouTube, I'm here for you today to share my memory books. Um, I've taken the liberty of taking everything out of it that I want to share beforehand, so I don't have deal with the edit.This is a birthday card for my sixteenth birthday and if you open it up it -This is my birthday this year that my family got me this card. My sister picked it out. Here's a little but -- a little, uh, button. I'll stick it on my shirt right now. It's a little pin thingy, and you -- and your parents, like, wear it on their shirts? From soccer, from when I was in second grade, that was summer soccer, not YMCA soccer. Um, hang on a second. I realized the webcam was falling, sorry. This is a thing in sixth grade that half the class signed. You pass it around the circle and everybody writes something about you, but it only got halfway through and everything. Um, this is from Megan -- Megan M. Even though you tease me, you are a really great person.I like talking soccer with you. Emily says, you are very nice, you definitely have done your New Year's Resolution, you don't give up -- which is funny because I have no clue what my New Year's Resolution was back then. Um, this is from Jason. You are very nice and kind to your softball friends -- yeah, good to know I was kind to everybody. Um, Mary says, you are more of a leader than I'll ever be. I remember reading that like -- um, these are official adoption papers from when I was in eighth grade, we had to do potato babies. On November third I adopted Leopold Emerson. This is a card my friend made me a long time ago. I decided to narrow down what I was going to be showing you a little bit because I'm heading really late into this and I know nobody's gonna wanna watch like a thousand minutes of me doing this.Anyway um, right here -- Certificate of Bravery from getting my ears pierced, at Walmart, and what I remember about this is um, my sister got her ears pierced for her second grade birthday, and I really wanted to go with her, but, uh I slept too late and she came out with her ears pierced and I cried really hard about it until my mom agreed me to go get me -- to get my ears -- uh, take me to get my ears pierced, and they, uh pierced my first ear and I cried really hard and screamed and I didn't want to get my other ear pierced.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG148","You guys ready for this? Here we go. Hello and welcome to the XXXX. Uh, all right, now this is an important video. I've been putting it off for a while. One of the reasons why I want to -- to do this now is 'cause I got a really great question about it.Hi, my name is XXXX and I'm considering getting dreads and I've been reading a lot about using dread wax versus not using it and I was just wondering if you could tell me the advantages and disadvantages to using dread wax.Thanks, XXXX for your question. So I'm gonna try to cover all the -advantages and the disadvantages of using dread wax -Um, the right way, and some of the rumors that have resulted because people have used it the wrong way quite a bit, all right? And as we'll see, it's pretty easy to misuse it, and that's one of the main problems. Before I -- I go much further, I wanted to tell you that all my thoughts on this subject are completely unbiased.Uh, I've used wax to start my dreads twice and I know that if I needed to start my dreads again, I would definitely choose to use wax. I know it works, I mean, I do know for like nine years now people have been using it and freaking out, freaking out about how fast their dreads lock and they send pictures and they're like, look at this, these are only three months old, yadda, yadda , love your stuff. It's not like I can come at this, like I don't really know, like, maybe wax is beneficial or not -- it's not really that big of a deal because I think the people that say, what eew? They're pretty biased too. Anyway, let's talk.The first rumor that we should talk about -- well, there's two parts to it. You have to use wax to lock up your hair, or wax prevents the hair from locking. Okay, now both of these are pretty popular, neither of them are true. So, let's talk about how wax works and I think that'll kinda clarify some of this a little bit.All right, wax works by keeping the hair together when you compress it. Okay? The natural dreading process is for the knots to tighten and the hair to get used to being in the knots, just like hair in a braid gets used to being in a braid. You know, you put your hair in -- in all braids, I don't know if you've ever done that, I've never done that, um anyway, wait maybe I did, so you wash it in a braid and then you take it out and it's all curly and wavy like a braid. And that's because it's getting used to that shape, all right.Well, the hair gets used to knots exactly the same way, and over time it gets so used to them that it can knot again tighter. You tighten your knots and you compress the dread by palm rolling. Here we go, palm rolling, uh, and by sleeping on them. Okay? You crunch 'em down, it gets all knotted and stuff, and they sit there for a little while, okay and then they're used to it and they're ready to crunch down and get tighter and they sit there and get used to it and they crunch down, and they get even tighter and that's how you end up with a ridiculously tight rope like dreads that uh, that everybody wants, that's a mature dread. Which is usually what you're going for, when you're growing dreads.Wax helps by preventing the hair from losing the progress while it's getting used to the knot, all right? If it is sitting there and you take a shower, and all the -- you know, everything opens back up again, then you're starting all over, pretty much, or not quite all over, not quite all over, not quite all over. I mean eventually, you know, it can still tighten, but it's gonna take a lot longer because you've lost that progress.When you have wax in the hair, it holds that progress. So it allows you to squeeze it down when you palm roll, and then it kinda stays there. Eh, it opens up a little bit, it opens up a little bit, but the majority of the progress that you've made when you tighten 'em down, you get to keep that. And that's the difference -- that's why wax helps the dreads mature faster.Another rumor that you'll hear that's kinda related to this is that wax works like glue, okay. It sticks the hair together -- and the hair, the dreads can't mature. Well that's completely bullshit. There might be some wax that works that way, if there were, yeah, it wouldn't work, that's true. If you put glue in your dreads, you're not -- it's not gonna lock up. Glue sticks the hair together and when you compress it, it doesn't do anything, all right. So then, when the glue finally comes out, so do the dreads, 'cause they -- 'cause the knots never tightened.The other rumor, uh, that I mentioned where wax prevents the hair from dreading, some wax does. Not good wax, but a lot of the stuff out there that you'll find in the store is full of petroleum and they call it dread wax, but it say, you know, contains one hundred percent pure beeswax. Yeah, I bet it does. It has like two grams in like this big jar, you know. Unfortunately, the rest of it , and petroleum is a lubricant, so you can imagine, if you put it on your dreads and you tighten 'em down, it's gonna make them open back up nice and quick. Like even faster than they would on their own.If you end up with petroleum in your dreads, just wash it out real good and get some good wax in there. We have a lot of people that try the petroleum stuff first and then they're like, can I save my dreads jolly clean and I'm like, yeah man, you can save 'em. And they do and it's great, so whatever, don't worry, it's all good. Actually got that question too again, and it's that guy right there.The last thing I want to mention there is your hair type. Your hair type determines how hard it is for your hair to lock. Some hair is more resistant to tightening. Okay really, really straight coarse hair is gonna be the hardest. Think like Asian hair, okay? Each strand is really big and really straight, so to get it to relax into a knot is gonna be much harder than if your hair is really, really fine and really kinky and curly already, really, really fine and really kinky, really kinky. That's why some people have a harder time.The good news is, the wax gives it that extra hold so that it's gonna knot and it's gonna become dreads, you know, instead of being mature in maybe like four months, it'll take six months or eight months, maybe even a full year, you know. But you're gonna get dreads and it's not like a, you know, if thing. It's a when thing.Uh, rumor number two. The not so much. That's definitely not true. And it's caused people a lot of problems. People heard that dread wax made dreads lock faster and smoother, and I want my hair to lock up really fast and I want it to be really smooth, so I'm gonna use a ton of wax. They caked it on like a hippy with a . It doesn't work, but it does make a mess. Any wax can be overused. Even if it's, uh, the best dread wax available. It still can be overdone and it will still cause you problems when you overdo it.A lot of people, and you know, you'll see them on message boards and stuff like that, they've sworn off dread wax completely. Well why don't you tell me at the same time, why? They've associated over waxing with waxing and now they don't want to touch wax. And, you know, their dreads are gonna take a little bit longer. And that's fine, whatever, I'm not you know, like, you must use wax for your dreads. Obviously that's not true. There's definitely a disadvantage to uh -- to overdoing it and you can avoid those disadvantages by not overdoing it.Dread wax doesn't hurt dreads. Over waxing hurts dreads. It's like, people don't kill people, guns kill people, or guns don't kill people, people kill people. How does that go again? If you do decide to use wax, use it properly. Over waxing is a disorder. It's like, uh, overeating, you know, so don't do that.Oh, let's talk about some of the rumors that are related to over waxing. Waxing, uh oh, waxing makes you feel waxy. No, that's not true. But, one of the things that I like least about using wax is that even when you put the right amount in and you work it in well, you're still gonna feel it in the hair, uh for about a day or so. You're gonna feel it, you know, on your hands when you touch your hair and stuff and that's annoying. A lot of people don't like tacky wax feeling on their dreads and dude, I'm right there with you.The good news is, you can get around that just by putting a little bit of dread butter on the surface of the dreads. If you're gonna use wax, you should have it on hand, 'cause it really makes a huge difference. Just the whole experience is gonna be better, honestly. You can put it on right after you put on the wax, so the surface that you're touching or that other people are touching is not tacky. Yeah, because you feel the dread butter and the dread butter is smooth and you don't feel the tacky wax. And it smells really freaking awesome. People will be trying to eat your dreads and stuff. You'll be like, no, don't eat my dreads, it's odd. It's like that, really. Gotta love it. And that pretty much takes care of that.This is it for Part A, man, you can go watch Part B.","High","High","High"

"VLOG15","Well, hello everyone and welcome to the XXXX. It's December twenty ninth two thousand and six. A couple of days left in this year and we'll be in a whole new year. I certainly hope that, uh, two thousand and seven is a great year for everybody watching and I hope that our country and the world has a much better year than we've had this past year. Well I want to start right off today by talking about some of the things that are in the news. In fact that's today's shows about, it's a news day. Um, and a hot topic has got to be everywhere in this country, at least tech wise has got to be Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs is in the news today and, uh, he is being investigated by the Securities Exchange Commission for possibly accepting some, uh, some stocks under a um -- I'm not exactly sure what's going on -- I don't want to make some comments that are inaccurate, but he is being investigated in that manner.Now I saw on the Today Show that most people buying Apple related equipment would still do so whether Steve Jobs was indicted for problems or not and I, uh, I would understand that assumption. But nonetheless, um, the fact that a high profile businessman like Jobs might be involved in some irregular stock purchasing, if you will, reminds you of somebody else don't it, a chef of some kind? Yes, that happened with her too, uh, Miss Stewart if I recall. I guess all that money just gets-- everybody gets itchy when they see that potential and they can't keep their hands off.I was once told that there is group of people that, uh, that cannot keep their hands off money when it's there to be had. Um, gosh isn't that something, Steve Jobs.Anyhow, let's move right along because we don't want to go too long on this um on any of these subjects.As everyone knows Gerald Ford recently passed away; the former President of the United States filled in for Richard Nixon. Was not reelected but was nonetheless a very popular man. And, uh, gave a interview to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. Everyone knows Bob Woodward and of course, um, he gained his fame from the Nixon tapes and Bob Woodward just loves to jump on things whenever he's got the opportunity. And, um, Ford gave him this interview on his views of, uh, whether or not the Iraq War should have started and of course under the agreement that the interview would not be published until Ford's death. Well boy oh boy, what do you think, the day Ford is dead, Woodward is out there telling everybody, telling the world. And, um, the man's not even in the ground yet and the word is spread around the world that Gerald Ford, a very popular President of the United States, a former President, uh, was against the war in Iraq. Old Bob Woodward just cannot wait to get his hands on the money if you will. I saw he was on the Today Show being interviewed and that's what the man wanted and he is getting it right now.Another thing in the news right now and everybody knows about it by the time they see this on the web. Saddam Hussein might be gone. He might be gone from this earth. He was scheduled to hang, and, uh, potentially be hanged by the end of this weekend if -- if not the beginning of this weekend. And, um, he is a former Dictator of Iraq and he is being charged and convicted of killing over a hundred and some innocent men and boys. And he should be put to death and, uh, and very quick. I've always been of the opinion, when he was found in the hole in the ground that he was hiding, that chicken shit. Uh, somebody should've put a bullet right then and there, just in case he somehow eluded capture or eluded, uh, justice. Who knows what could happen but anyhow he is scheduled to die and that's a good thing.So after that who knows what's going to happen in Iraq. I certainly hope for the best for, uh, all the countries involved. For our country, all the men and women that are over there and, um, and, uh, everybody involved. Okay, that's the Sophie Show for today. I hope everybody had a good time and um, I'll be putting together another one real soon. I'm playing it by ear, as something comes along I put it up. I put things up that, um, that I find that I think are worth looking at and, um, I put things up that I make. So it's a variety show and I hope you enjoy it and keep coming back and looking for more. Bye for now.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG150","﻿Hello everyone. It's been a long time since I made a video so I thought that I probably should.Not much has been up with me. On Halloween, I dressed up as a fairy. And I've still been trying to find a job. I actually had an interview today, so hopefully the job soon. It's now been a little over two months since I have been back to America and I have started to really miss Japan a lot lately. I had a lot of people ask me before whether I preferred living in America or Japan, and you know, there are pros and cons of living in both countries so of course it's going to depend on the individual person. I'd probably say that if all of my family and my good friends lived in Japan and I knew how to speak and understand Japanese fluently, then I probably would rather live in Japan. It feels like when I was in Japan I was just less stressed out, relaxed, and I just had a good feeling while I was there.In America, of course, I can understand the language and it might be a little easier to do everyday things here. But I do miss the friendly, polite people in Japan, and I miss the scenery and architecture even, totally just because I've lived in America for so many years that it's just boring to me now. I don't know how people from other countries view American architecture but it feels like, to me anyway, I prefer the architecture in other countries. I actually at one point had a list of a lot of ideas for videos that I wanted to do and I tried finding the list and I can't find it. I made the list in Japan, but I made sure that I packed it so that I'd have it here. Um, so hopefully I'll be able to find that soon and make some more -- more planned videos. You can see a little bit of my apartment in the background. This apartment complex was built in the nineteen sixties so there's some lovely wood paneling behind me. I'm not so into the wood paneling but it's pretty cheap rent so, I can handle it.Probably one of the reasons I haven't been on YouTube in so long is that I kind of got addicted to NetFlix and Dexter. I've been watching a lot of movies. I just saw a lot of footage that I haven't put together from Japan so, I'll try to do that soon too for you guys and I will have to leave you. Goodbye.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG151","﻿That was three of my top brackets. These actually haven't, all -- of all three of them. And I would like to know what your brackets are and you can either make a video response or if you've got any comments. Video response would be much better for this because I think it requires a degree of emotion, and of course presentation.If you'd like to just explain it or make an actual video like I did, a full video with an action, then that would be cool as well.I'll watch them all, I'll try to read all the comments.Thanks for watching this, I really appreciate it.I can't wait to hear from everyone who participates, so goodbye and I hope you enjoyed this video.﻿Hello. So I was just um, sitting down laying around, eh, when I thought of a concept. Recently I had read a novel, The Last King of Scotland, and em, I spent quite a lot of time reading the text and I noticed one thing about the book -- there was a lot of em, use of brackets, or if you're American -- parentheses, I believe it's called. Basically, you em -- you read the book and you get the dialogue and the writer. But sometimes in the book the writer likes to -- the character who the writer is, em -- has wrote about likes to elaborate on -- on a subject or likes to give their real opinion, as opposed to what they said in the book. So you might have like -- something like -- oh yeah, sure I'll do this, and then in brackets it'll say, like, I did not want to do this -- something like that. Or it -- it'll provide more detail.Now I was thinking about if there were brackets in real life, like say you were asked a question and you reply to this question. What you say may not -- may or may not be honest. It may be, em, a lie, white or otherwise. Maybe the true feelings it may not have been expressed in the response. I'd just like to share with everybody here a few of my brackets -- or what my brackets would be if we were able to see what people thought, or -- or if you were able to elaborate on something you'd already said. I'll just, em, show you now.So, Michael. I want you to clean this entire floor as quickly as possible. If you don't get it cleaned enough, em, I'm gonna make you stay until four thirty.I'll get right on it.I had a really great day, Michael.Me, too.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG152","﻿Okay guys, uh, this is going to be a three part video. Okay, part one. Okay, there's three parts. This is going to be three important parts and the first part is famous quotes and my quotes. One I'm pretty sure you've all heard. I love this one because we'd do anything for love and if it's horrible, you know, all is fair in love and war. I'm not sure who said it. I didn't research anything he said, um yeah, because most of them were mine and some of them -Okay, number two, keep your friends close and your enemies closer. I like that one, except like one of my worst enemies is now like one of my closest friends and seriously my best friend. And not even close to being my enemy any more.Um, three -- by the way this part is going to be short, time is a valuable thing and don't waste it. Okay? 'Cause, um, it's time. You can't stop time and it's a valuable thing.Four, never take life for granted, it can end at any mo -- or moment. Like right now, you could be driving a car and maybe you're on your laptop -- bam, your dead -- car accident. Life can end at any moment. Never take it for granted.Number five, one of my friends said this. I -- I'm not truly believing in it though, so mean you might, um -- you die -- you die inside when love dies. I'm not in to that, yep.Six, ah, this -- this is one that's kinda short. Never stop believing in whatever you believe in. Don't have someone discourage you from believing in it. Christians, believe in Lent or whatever. Like, today at school we were eating chocolate chip cookies and one of my friends gave up, um, chocolate for Lent and I'm like, are you serious? So he had to pick out the chocolate pieces. That really sucked. And seven, we all make mistakes. All of us -- all of us have it and we all do. There's not one perfect person out there who has not made a mistake. Remember that, not even one. You might think that you're perfect, but you're not. And life is unfair. It is. Get over it. It's unfair. Trust me. I used to think life was fair but it's not. Life is unfair and get over it. Stop being a baby and get over it. Life's unfair. I don't care how young you are, you need to learn that life's unfair. And you need to learn now.Okay, part two. Put this on paper so that I'd actually be able to remember. Okay, we are going to talk about Paper Towns. It was a fantastic book. I read it because one of my friends, XXXX, XXXX, um, XXXX, he -- XXXX said to call him XXXX -- he recommended it to me, off YouTube. He's one of my friends on here and he's a big YouTuber guy, blogger. And I told him this video's about Paper Towns and we're talking back and forth and he said, really I finished it in a day. It was awesome. It was a fantastic book.Huh Margo, huh Margo, Margo Roth, Roth Spiegelman. It really does get stuck because they always say Margo Roth Spiegelman and they never just say Margo. Well you -- sometimes they do. Also, you know Radar how his parents own a black santa thing -- even though if none of you have read it; you really need to read it. It's a fantastic book. And, oh yeah, you know the place Radar always gets on omnictionary? It's real. I typed it in at home and I then I'm, like, I wonder if it's real, www dot omnictionary dot com, and it's real. It talks about Margo, I think Margo's real. I'm not sure. I don't really care right now -- and it's real. And it's really interesting and I like it. So, I made an account and -- it's a fantastic book I think that all of you should read it. Yeah, and hey Shainalicious I hope you watch this video -- video because, thank you. It's a great book. I have been talking to him messages about that.Part three, probably the second best part, maybe the first best part for some of you. Okay, we all remember the Joe from nineteen ninety three and how he looked and he said that he was going to create a new account, right? Yeah, guess what? I found his new account and I know it's him. So, I will have a link in it. And I'll have a link in the side bar for XXXX and the -- his account, his new account, um, it's called XXXX, he's not eighteen now, and you can tell just by watching some of the videos, it's him. And it's him and it's really awesome. One of his rules is don't talk about him but, hey, I know you guys have been wondering so bad, so, uh -- so he won't be happy, so he -- might be mad that he-- that I found it that -- he felt that he actually did create a new account and I found it. So, I hope that you guys enjoy this. Watch this video and subscribe. Uh, go to the sidebar and subscribe to XXXX. Subscribe to XXXX or just go look at their account. Yeah? Just do that for me. You don't even have to subscribe to me but I'd be happy if you did. Yeah so, well, might be it. Let's check. That's part three out of three, so that's it, so it's XXXX signing off.

"VLOG153","﻿So like, I wanted to bring up a really kind of interesting point -- uh -- first off, you know, I'm still shocked that Michael Jackson is gone -- um -- I have nothing but respect for him. I just wanted to bring up a point about some of the rumors that are spread about him, and just offer you a little bit of insight on what those might mean. So like a lot I've talked to those know that people like to jump on the wagon of spreading rumors, and let's face it, rumors don't really involve any kind of thinking, and a lot people don't like to think. So perfect -- there's your audience base. People in the media know that the more extreme something sounds, the more people are gonna wanna watch it and listen to it, and that's why some of these rumors get spread about him.Okay like, one of the funny things is, is that a lot of the media personalities who say these horrible things about Michael Jackson, they don't really believe them. But that's how they get views, and that's how their shows get attention. But like, you know, the only thing that's really left to say about Michael Jackson is you know, number one, he is gone. And number two, he left us with amazing music, and -- um -- you know, I really think we could just let that be.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG154","This is it, summertime. It hasn't sunk it yet I'm on my holidays -- I was down the shops with my mum and I was like, I should be at the house. And then I thought, no, I shouldn't. It looks like everyone's predictions for Biology came up anyway, funny , though it would have been easier if I'd studied a bit more so it's no one's fault but my own, but they were fine. I was really good, but I was kinda stuck for time at the end -- I was scribbling, scribbling away and drawing and everyone else like finished this week finished today, finish yesterday, finish tomorrow, anyone? What're they gonna do the next year, I'd say, do not worry about it, because everyone, they -- it seems like there's this big hype on it and that, oh my God, it's this terrible thing, but it's really, really not.You're sitting there doing it and you're like, is this really ? It's not like it seems at all, and anyone doing it right now will tell you that. I would feel a bit more unstressed if my books weren't still on the floor, and my sheets and everything, and my shoulder's sore, but now it's time to re lax. Uh, how's everyone fixed for German tomorrow? Um, I ask because I've got a few friends doing German so -- ich bin, something, something. Don't forget tomorrow's my last blog, so you'd better get your questions in now because it's now or never. And you know what else is really good? I was complaining 'bout it, but it's been raining and it's been miserable all week, which is good.I hope it stays like that until the end of the leaving because do you remember all other years, it would be really, really, sunny, I remember during the Junior , it was really sunny? So leave me a comment everybody, or a video response there. What else is on this -- German tomorrow? I'm really not sure. But um, yeah. Leave me a comment everybody or a video response, and tell me how you're getting on, just ask me anything if you want. And you know yourself, 'kay? Bye.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG155","﻿Hi, YouTube. It's Wednesday, October 28, 2009 and I don't know about you but I grew up in the nineties and I was born and raised on Nickelodeon Slime Time Live, Spice Girls, NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, I grew up on all of that stuff. For me the nineties were filled with crazy awesome Halloween excursions with my brother. Uh, nothing too crazy mind you. It was just, you know, us three going around the neighborhood dressed up as, uh, Power Rangers -- I don't even know what we were dressed up as. Uh, I was always a bride or a princess or ballerina and they were always, like, a ninja or the Grim Reaper but we'd go around and we'd fill up our pillow cases with candy and we'd keep those bags of candy for months after Halloween. And I remember we'd have to clean them out of the refrigerator because they'd just gotten so gross and old and ugh. But just thinking about it has made me really nostalgic and it's made me miss my childhood because now that I'm in college -- you don't see many eighteen, nineteen, twenty year olds going trick or treating on Halloween. I mean you might but it's not really, uh, acceptable. I know I'm not going trick or treating this year. This will be my first year actually staying home and not really going out there. I just really like seeing people dressed up in costumes and thinking about how much work it took them to make it or how they thought to be a certain thing. I am always a big advocate for making costumes. I was an orange juice carton one year. I had a great time. Actually two years ago. This year I was an Undead Wendy and XXXX was Peter Pan so that was cool too. I was gonna be Pam from The Office but I decided not to be. I don't know. Um, not so -- in the comment below tell me your favorite Halloween moment or, uh, if you don't celebrate Halloween tell me your favorite type of candy because candy is kind of related to Halloween and I love candy. I'm actually, you know, I'm actually munching on some Hershey's with almonds. That's the only way I'll eat Hershey's is if it has almonds in it. Alright. Thanks for watching and I'll see you tomorrow.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG156","Do I think it's gonna be great? Absolutely.Let's get on with the music. It's a project that, uh, me and my man XXXX are putting together and, um, he produced the entire thing. It's about -- about sixteen records on there. We started working on it in January, so it's been about -- about eight months -- roughly eight months, but, you know, we just felt that, you know, we wanted to take a little longer on it, you know what I'm saying, because we wanted it to be spectacular.As far as, um, guest features on the project; we got my man XXXX, Arizona. Got a record called, Don't Want to Lose Your Love. And got my man,XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, the XXXX, my home girl, XXXX, lovely XXXX, out of Phoenix, Arizona as well. And my man, DJ XXXX; No XXXX my DJ. Uh, he did a couple of cuts on the project, you know what I'm saying, so my man, XXXX, the XXXX, you know what I'm saying? We got a record called the XXXX.As far as the release date, you know, we're shooting for November of o nine. I will be having a listening party soon, you know what I mean; just to give people a vibe for it and everything. You know, I leaked a few records, you know what I'm saying, nowadays it's like you gotta leak, you know what I mean. It's all about leaking joints.We put two hundred percent into a project. It definitely reflects on the material and it shows. And that's how I feel with this project. You know, we really went all in and, you know. You just gotta hear it, that's all I have to say, you just gotta hear it. Let's get on with the music. I am Mr. XXXX and that's what it is, y'all. Peace. Moved on. Bags packed, ready to roll. I moved on. Honey, get the show on the road. I moved on. Even though we had that chemistry, a real fun time, now considered a memory.","High","High","High"
"VLOG158","﻿Hi, everyone. How's it going? I've been debating for quite some time now what sort of video I should be putting up next. I've got a few concepts for a few serious videos and I felt the need to do a funny one first, but it just wasn't happening.I am working a new job now, as many of you perhaps know already, for the BBC, for their comedy department. It is a dream come true and it's a privilege to be working with a team of great people. Uh, and it's been really, really good fun. If you want to see the sort of stuff I've been working on, then there is a link of their channel. If you click it, you can see it and comment and whatever you do comment on a video or on the channel, um, the likelihood is that I will see it, so um, yeah.But in general lately, um, I've been through another crazy point in my life and some of you here remember watching my videos from last year -- it was on the lead up to Christmas, and I'm going through the motions at the moment and I just haven't had a chance to stop and, you know, relax and get on with, you know, the things I used to, like make YouTube videos.So this is just a quick update video to say that if you don't see videos from me for a while, this is why. I hope to come back very, very soon. Uh, and if you do want to stay in touch and up to date, because I still do my live shows, um, and I do still come along -- online from time to time uh, the best way is for you to Twitter. I update that and I will always be posting info of when I'm doing projects, et cetera. Um, whether it's at my work at the BBC or if it's a live show or if it's just anything of particular interest.I do want to come back and make videos, um, but I'm just going to have to put that off at the moment. So, I've been getting a lot of emails the past few weeks asking when I'm going to be making another video and instead of answering them individually I just thought I'd put this up here for the meantime.So thank you everyone for the support, and I hope to see you soon. And if it's in the new year, I hope you have a great Christmas uh, and to a happy new year. Bye.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG159","Hey friends, it's XXXX and I am doing an update. Um. I am feeling so much better than I was feeling on Monday on my last video, um. I remember, or if you remember if you watched it -- I was whining that I've been losing and gaining the same five pounds for over three months now. And you know, I'm a hundred and sixty pounds, a hundred fifty nine this morning. Um. Whatever, okay, just whatever.So um, let me tell you why I'm feeling better. When I was doing the Couch to Five pay program, I was like so excited about running because like -- you should start with sixty second sprints at week one and I was like, oh my God I can't run sixty seconds, I can't run, oh I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I can't even run down the driveway. Anyway and so when I would run sixty seconds and I made it through the whole week being able to do that, at that very last run when it was over it was like, oh my God, oh my God, I am finished. I had graduated week one, I'm on to week two, and then all during the weekend before I started week two I was thinking, oh my gosh, it's ninety second sprint. How am I gonna do that, I thought I was gonna die at sixty seconds. Even though I did it, I thought I was gonna die. And so then when did the ninety seconds I was like, Oh! I did it, I did it, I did it you know, and I was just so excited. And this happened week to week to week to week, and you, and then I finally made it through to week nine and was able to run for a full thirty minutes at a time.And then I did my races, um, and was able to fun a full five K without stopping which was like, the biggest high ever. And you know, the whole time that I was doing it, doing my training, I never did think about okay, I wonder how many calories this is burning, and oh my -- I did think a lot that it sucked because it's exercise. But the whole time I was also thinking, I can't believe I'm doing this, I can't believe my body is capable of doing this and the whole time that I was doing it my body was changing and don't get me wrong, I know that I wasn't a year out then, and you know I was losing weight quicker which really wasn't that quick for me if you remember. But maybe two pounds a week was really, really good.But anyway, it was something I was excited about, and it wasn't always about the scale because I was doing something else that was bigger, something that was like more meaningful than watching the scale move. And since then, I've been exercising for the benefit of exercise and trying to make it that scale goes down, you know what I mean? And I've been focusing on the scale again and it's just not -- it's not fulfilling, it's frustrating because the scale's not moving. I'm over a year out, you know it's kind of hard.And so um, you know I was thinking, I want that passion, I want that goal to, you know, to keep getting better and better and better and seeing progress, and not talking losing sadness or watching the scale, I'm talking about my body being able to do something that it never could do before because I was obese. So anyway, I found, well I decided, remember last year I was like oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I ran the gate river run five K that is. It wasn't even the gate river run but it was on the day of the gate river run and its where the gate river run started, it was a public quarter time junior and something run for charity or something like that. But anyway the gate river run is a fifteen K and I said last year I'm doing that one next year which will be in March of two thousand and ten. And you know, I am. I am able to run. Now I can't run fifteen K but there are I mean like, Jamie and Tom, there are people that are out there who used to be obese who are training for marathons and have marathons and you know what, I am going to train also. I found a website, I'm gonna put it over in this way, in the side. It has all kinds of different programs to get you training for a race. Um. Even walking. And it has different levels too, so if you are just like wanting to train for a five K and you already can run a five k and you want to increase speed, it's got training for that.It's got all these different programs that you can do, it's got beginners or novice, intermediate and advanced. And it's got walking, jogging and running so if you can't run, what's stopping you from being able to train for walking a five K? I mean if you're only post op, that's what you should be doing. I mean a five K is three point one miles, so that may sound like it's you know, never gonna happen at this point. But you know you start with a quarter of a mile. And then you know you work up next week to do maybe half a mile. And you keep going until you're able to walk the entire five K. And the two races that I've been in they, the back people, all walked it, so there's no reason why you can't make that a goal for yourself to be able to walk in a race, and then maybe the next race you might run a little bit or jog, or whatever.And you know, it's very, very motivating and another thing that motivated me was actually going and registering for these races because I thought okay, I've already paid for it. It's usually about twenty bucks. I've already paid for it so now I've really gotta train because I won't be able to do it once it comes. So anyway, I was excited very much so, about that. I have decided to start training for -- I don't know if I wanna start training for the half marathon or the eight K or the fifteen K, it doesn't matter though. The fifteen K isn't until March. I wanna be well able to do it by then because I'm not gonna start -- I enjoy running. Um. And I'm in Florida. I don't want running on the treadmill, it's too monotonous and after like three minutes I think oh my God, I'm not done yet, oh besides I hate it, I'm so bored. But when I'm out in the neighborhood or on the streets or whatever you know I've got a matmorrun. com and I you know, map where I'm going, it tells me how far it is and when I take off, and you know it's motivating to be able to see scenery and feel the wind blow and the cars go buy, and listen to those kinds of things and you know I have my iPod too and -- plus I make the kids come with me on their bicycles behind me so that one could carry my water and they can go, Go mum, go and you know, You're doing great, and all that stuff. So anyway we're gonna look at the time.Okay. I've only got a couple of minutes. I did go my one year post op this week. And my doctor was just amazed, he was like, oh, most people don't do as good as you did, XXXX, and you know, that's just awesome. I didn't go and tell him that I have the YouTube support system and that I exercise more than the average patient, because a lot of people really do believe that you can just um, you know let their surgery do all the work and it can. And I'm not gonna be that way, I could tell I wanted to change my life, I wanted to get active, and so anyway I did tell him that I did two five K races and that you know, I work hard but didn't go into detail that I am strength training, that I go to the gym, and that I'm you know exercising all the time. So anyway, that goes to show you guys if you incorporate exercise, you're gonna do better than the average do, I think it's sixty to eighty percent um weight loss, excess weight that is, and I've lost like eighty five so far and I'm still not done. I asked him what my goal should be, I'm one sixty now, and he said that one forty. And that's what I wanted to be, remember guys? So I've got twenty pounds to go but I'm not gonna focus on that. I'm going to focus on training, and that will change my body. Um. And then what else am I gonna say. Oh, he said I have about five more months that I will slowly lose and you know, when I was busting my butt and everything I was only losing about four pounds a month anyway, so I'm not expecting to lose anything really, but if I do, that's great. I love my body, I love being a Five A, you know the number on the scale is very frustrating and annoying but honestly the whole thing is the number that's frustrating me. The number. Because I'm happy with the way I look.It's the number that irritates me, why? I don't know. Because if I look this way and it was a hundred forty pounds I would be thrilled, it's that freaking number that's got me obsessed. So screw the number, I'm gonna run and I hope you guys will start doing it with me. I'm gonna put a link over on the five of -- for the gate river run, it's the biggest fifteen K in the United States and it's for like the fifteen K championship and I would love for us to be able to run it together. Jamie come on, won't you come and run it with me? Anyway, gotta talk to you later, bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG16","Hi. My name is XXXX and I am the Idea Storm Manager at XXXX and I'm really excited to share something new with you today. XXXX has done Idea Storm for almost three years now. It has been an amazing, open crowd, sourcing concept for us and we generate over thirteen thousand ideas from the community. What we're doing now is taking it to the next level and we're adding a new section on the site called storm sessions. Storm sessions can best be described as targeted, relevant and time map ideas generating session. Let me tell you how it works. First Dell will initiate a storm session around the targeted topic that is relevant to our current business meetings. Then we want you, the community to post your ideas, to vote in common on ideas and basically to tell us what you think we should be doing on this topic. Then, the critical part of this is that we actually time map it so that we will close the session and start accepting ideas or votes. This is important so that we can review the information and create action plans based on your ideas. And finally we will come back and share with you exactly when and how we'll put these ideas into action. I'm really excited about this. We have two great sessions ready for launch and many, many more to come. So check it out today. Check it out in the future and tell us what you think we should be doing. Thank you.","High","Low","High"

"VLOG167","Well, I am so excited to talk to you today about goals, strategy and tactics, because I -- this is really the secret sauce.First off, the goal. Might sound like a no brainer but some people forget what it is, to increase revenue. Hello, we're in the business of making money, that's what we're supposed to be doing here. Uh, now a lot of people think of the strategy as being the goal. The strategy I'm going to use is to increase audience. That's a strategy to achieve that goal.There are lots of other ways to do it. Some through, you know, hacking staff, I mean that's one way to increase your revenue, right. Spend less money on people.I say increase the audience both on air and cross platform. There are a lot of platforms that are available to us for free so let's utilize every tool in the arsenal we possibly can. And by the way, interactive audience, because an interactive audience is much more likely to be salable to the clients, and that's what we're looking for right there.Now, a variety of tactics we're going to use -- I told you before I didn't really wanna let the cat out of the bag and all my different tactics, but I'll give you a peek inside the bag. You know what happens when a wild cat gets loose? You heard about that right? Good. All right, well, first off, on air tactics.Uh, first off, make every break count. I mean, every break. Use cultural touchstones. I mentioned in my morning show philosophy that there are assignments that are handed out to the various people on the show, and that really that all that is, is, well what are you planning on doing today?Well, I'm going to watch, uh, you know the World's Biggest Loser or whatever. And so that person is in charge of watching that and coming up with two or three observations they can share with us on the air. We can slot that into a thing, maybe come up with a Biggest Loser bid or something like that, but that's what that's all about, cultural touchstones, things that other people are going through. Maybe they're just going out to eat that night and that's their assignment, go out to eat, but observe and come in with some observations based on that. Um, balancing the clock because of that.Now, part of making every break count is making sure that you're hitting all the surface elements, that you're hitting all the different uh, information about the artists, that you're doing the cultural touchstones, that you've got something funny going on, a little something for everybody in every quarter hour, little mini shows within shows.Spiking the phones. That's a big one that people neglect a lot of times. Well the phones aren't ringing. Well it works two ways, call people, give 'em a line, have them feed it back to you, now you've got interaction. And there's something about success. It feeds more success, so you can do that stuff.Uh, engaging the listeners on every level possible; that might mean, uh, going out and talking to people on the street as well when you engage the listeners.Better interviews, here's an idea for you. Interviews, not just on the telephone or in studio, but using, uh, g mail's video chat or just even audio chat online. You set up an account for 'em, a dummy account; they can sign into that thing, now you've got studio quality sound in your studio. Sounds like they're right there, or pretty close to it. Sounds a whole lot better than a telephone, it's not so fatiguing on the air, much more interesting. And the liners that you get, whoo, a whole lot better.All right, oh by the way, no contest in the morning show. They're games, games are much more fun to listen to. Gosh, I'm just barely scratching the surface on my on air stuff, uh, more on air stuff.How about a window sticker campaign? I always call them window stickers because a bumper sticker, while that's down, it's on the paint, maybe, and people don't like to do that. And by the way, when you're parked behind a car, what do you see? You see the window in front of you, you don't see the bumper, 'kay? The window sticker is line of sight, but uh, it's labor intensive to get those on cars. Don't just put them in stores or hand them out to people at contests, at remotes and things. Put them on cars. Register people to win a contest. And do that for an extended period of time. A sustained effort and you're going to see your stickers, I promise you, everywhere. They will be more ubiquitous than UK stickers. They really, really will.How about being an on street ambassador? Street level ambassadors. When you're out doing stuff, your personality is switched on, baby. You're doing stuff. You're -- you're interacting with people in line at the grocery store, talking about what's on the front page of the magazine. Maybe saying something funny or just making an observation. Maybe they recognize you, maybe they don't but they're -- believe me, by the end of the conversation, they can engage. Listen to what they're saying. Interact with the community. Uh, invited them to listen to the show, or to even call in. Give 'em a card, write the telephone number on there to the warm line. And by the way, a warm line is an important thing we can talk about in the future.Uh, MOS - man on the street stuff. You know, I carry with me my little pocket recorder all the time. Here it is, right here. I take this out with me and I'm always ready to ask people questions and I can get a variety of 'em and then whenever it's uh, time to put those in the computer I just, uh, pull this apart, slide it in, edit it up, it takes no time at all and you've got a really cool bit. Now -- now you're ready to answer some telephone calls as people interact with the folks they heard on the street. And by the way, the people you talk to on the street, I'm going to be on the radio tomorrow, be sure to listen. See, that's how it works.Every event you do, every appearance that you do, every remote broadcast, it's an event of some sort. There's something extra going on. It's not just, we're selling cars down here at the car mart. Now there's something different going on in each one of 'em. Some reason other than a sale for them to come out.Uh, it's fun to play the games in person, to watch the games, do things like, I don't know, Pepsi bowling, do the Turkey Hurl, whatever it happens to be. Have a pie eating contest, something that's fun for people to do, something that's different, that people will talk about, that they'll come out to see, that works for the client, and it's more fun on the air than just, we've got sale items. Uh, who cares about your sale items, frankly? Really? Other things you can do, hire an entertainer. Hire a magician, hire a guy that makes balloon animals or uh, a singer, a band, whatever it is. Uh, they'll a lot of times do that just for the mentions on the air. Tell 'em you'll -- you'll tease 'em for a week in advance and let them pass out cards at the event. Or pay 'em some nominal fee, 50 bucks whatever it is, you know, at the particular event. They'll come out, believe me, they'll come out. Uh, another thing you can do is have some sort of contest. You have the pie eating contest, get some local heavyweights, maybe an anchor from another station or a politician who's uh, wanting to, you know, kiss hands and shake babies -- excuse me, shake hands and kiss babies, and bring them out to the event. Should be a lot of fun.Um, community involvement, but careful, strategic community involvement. Not overextending the station, that's why I have the -- the two charity rule, typically. Now, you can do some other things, especially like around Christmas time when you have things like the Toys for Tots campaign, that wouldn't count as a major campaign or anything, but something you could actually do. Um, by the way, don't do politically divisive stuff. By that I mean, maybe something, recycling as innocuous as it sounds, strikes some people the wrong way, strikes other people in a different way and it just has political connotations it didn't use to have that we don't need to have.I devised a campaign, I recycled, I can't remember -- tons. I think it was something like fifty tons of phone books in Reno. I got a commendation for doing that. Uh, it was a big deal in nineteen ninety one. Recycling now smacks of uh, too green for some people, not green enough for others and so, ain't no sense in going in that direction. But you can raise money, you can raise awareness. Actually make a difference in at least one charity.Exploit your TV connections, by the way. Here's another thing you can do on the air. When a celebrity is coming to town, uh, and they're going to be in the studio with you, contact a TV station, let 'em know that stuff, okay? Oh, and if they won't come, then you set up a couple of cameras, one trained on the celebrity, one trained on the overall ark of what's going on in the control room. You just cut back and forth between them, take the sound off the air, now you've got something you can put online. That's gonna come in a later tip, a little tidbit, a little tactic that you can use.When an event has great visuals, TV stations and, Diane, you know this -- um, TV stations are always looking for something interesting, something visual, something exciting and different, local that they can put on the air. If you can provide that for them, they'll love you and they'll put you on and everybody's friends. Um, if they don't turn up then you can shoot the stuff yourself or have an intern shoot it or whatever and -- and have the visuals, edit it for them and they're ready to go.Look for angles that benefit the TV viewer, not that just benefit the TV station -- they're -- they, uh -- producer's gonna wonder, why should I put this on the air? Give them a reason, tell them why it's important to their viewers and they'll want to do it. Invite, uh, the anchors or reporters on the air. Or just on the telephone. Interact with them, talk with them. Laugh, cut up, show the man behind the curtain for them too. They'll love doing that and it's good for both of you. Partner on a big charity event, whether it's a food drive or whatever it is, with a TV station, with an anchor, that kind of a thing. Find a way to get involved. You get TV coverage, out of it, they get radio coverage out of it. One hand washes the other, everybody's happy.I've only talked about tactics on the air. Still to come, we have YouTube tactics, Facebook tactics and Twitter tactics. I'm going to get to those in the next video. I hope you'll watch those as well. But here we go, here we have our goal, to raise revenue, our strategy, by increasing audience awareness; and you can't just sit in the station anymore, you have to touch people. This is how it's done. And the third thing is the tactics and we're getting right through that.","High","High","High"
"VLOG168","﻿Hey guys, it's been ages since I made a video, which I apologize, obviously. But I have two very good reasons why.Number one, school. For I've been sitting in a classroom with a few other people, with a man at the front or a woman talking at us and hoping something goes in. That's basically what I've been doing for the past few weeks. But now it's summer. I've got more time. Recently, as well, keeping me out from making videos -- you know it's putting me into the outside world, which I don't usually enter.The weather -- it has been gorgeous. It's been sunny. What I really hate about is with the weather -- when it's raining and it's chucking it down, which is ninety percent of the year, everyone's complaining. Oh it's raining, why isn't it sunny? I hate this. Then when it's sunny, oh it's too hot, I'm boiling, make it rain. You know, make up your mind.The only problem with our heat waves is, they only last for a few days. I hate that. You know, we've got this forty degrees of sun, beating down on us. It's beautiful. And then suddenly God realizes His mistake, oh God, I've made it sunny in Britain, so let's punish them with forty days of thunderous storm and that's what we had. After the beautiful heat wave, we had just rain and they chucked it down for -- it was like four months of rain in one day just because He'd realized that He'd played Britain sunny for a few days. Really ticks me off.So I guess school and sun have been keeping me away from the internet and outside, not sure about that. The only problem with the summer; it does make you realize that there's nothing to do at home unless it's sunny. You know, you're stuck inside wondering, what can I do? I guarantee, you'll all be bored at least once this summer.I'll also guarantee you'll go to the cinema at least once and unfortunately you're probably go to see Ice Age in three D. The great thing about that, apart from the awful movie, they give you free pair of glasses. You know, brilliant, I'm giving my pair of glasses instead of keeping them in my pocket and they ended up being thrown away; as I was bored one Saturday morning, I did a bit of um, arts and crafts um, and with a permanent marker and a pair of scissors, I created my very own design with three D glasses.Here we go. Yeah, you know, I was bored, so I thought, why not? I said, I'm really sad at the moment, I had nothing to do and the craze at the moment, with what everyone is wearing, and these wacky sunglasses, you know, that you got the bright yellow pink ones. You know, you got loads of them, so I thought why not make my own? Okay, you like it? Yeah? I think that's gonna be my new look, there you go.","High","High","High"

"VLOG17","﻿I worked through retro -You want to go to a dirty overpriced dung palace? You go to a restaurant. When your mom is too lazy to cook, restaurant. When you dad burns his Stouffer's in the microwave, restaurant.One thing I have to ask for all those restaurant owners; why is it that there is always under cooked meat? Come on, it looks like the inside of my mouth. Ew. Why is there always dirty floors? Like, I went to a CiCi's Pizza and, literally, it looked like a concert underneath my table. Coke bottles everywhere, little bit of blood and mud. And I sit there and wait forever for food; I mean I always end up with undercooked meat anyway so why does it take you so damn long?","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG170","Guess why I'm wearing this hat, besides the fact that it's really, really cold out and this hat is pretty awesome, because it is purple, it matches my sweatshirt and my hair and my pants which you can't see through there. Whoo, I'm wearing this hat, because right now, and almost every other second of my life, um, I have the ridiculous urge to pull out my hair. This is a disease call trichotillomania and I have had it for about eleven years since fifth grade.Trichotillomania, basically what I just said, is a disease that causes people to compulsively pull out their hair. Yeah, it sucks I've had to wear hats for like months and months and months on end, because like I wouldn't have any hair. And, that's actually the reason that I shaved my head at the end of freshman year. So, my project for Awesome Video this year is in support of the Trichotillomania Learning Center. This is an online resource for children, teens, adults, parents and families of those who have trichotillomania.I remember that I was really, really embarrassed to talk about my problems, until I got to college and found a really, really good support group of friends and in the Harry Potter community. For adults it is not as hard to talk about, because they have all ready come into their own as a person and they aren't as embarrassed to talk about stuff that bothers them. But, for kids, especially adolescents, oh my gosh, can you imagine how difficult it would be, if you were going bald and had to wear a hat to school every day and were embarrassed to tell your friends. I know how it feels and the Learning Center offers support, especially for adolescents and teens and young adults who are having lots of problems with trichotillomania.I don't really have much more to say, but if you want to learn more about trichotillomania or get involved or donate; you can visit the link in the sidebar. I hope this project for Awesome Day is wonderful for all of you guys and I hope you all find some new charities to support. And I'm so excited that I get to do a project for Awesome again, because it is one of my favorite YouTube videos of the year. So, yay, project for Awesome.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG171","Hey, YouTube. I'd just like to tell you two things that bother me. One, is -- well, I'll just give you a little introduction. One day at sailing, the -- somehow the subject of gays came up and bis and straights. And this one little said, I know somebody who's gay.  And she said it, like, it was, like, amazing. And it was, like, she just like broke a world record. And, I'm like -- and I said, Oh, aren't you special.  Because, I know many people who are gay. Well, look, I know many people who are gay, and they have to cope through so many things. And what I hate, absolutely hate, is how people say, Oh, that's so gay.  Or because they don't like the fact that someone's gay, so they're like, Oh, that's so gay,  instead of Oh, that's so shitty. Oh, that's so crappy. Oh, that's garbage. Oh, I hate that.  Say that. Because you have no idea what these people have to go through every single day. Okay? I hope it's cool, with you guys.Number two. Yeah, I don't hate this as much, because this is their self hate. They -- they have to choose this. They have to choose. I can't tell them, 'cause I'm not sure what I actually understand what it is . I can't understand what these people are going through because if they want to cut themselves, then they have to be going -- I can't -- they -- they have to be going through something way harder than I knew. So I just, like, live life every day, and I'm all like, Woo. Party.  But I can't understand what the thing that's going through these people's minds, because they truly are troubled and I can't help them. Well, I can, but. . . You? And me? We can help them. So, people who, like, cut themselves and self injure themselves; I don't really know what to say, 'cause I know many people who do that. Who cut. And they're all, like, some of them are really close friends. Some of them aren't. But, like, I know them, and if you know someone, then -- anyway, it's like they're in here. Somewhere you just know them. So don't just, like, blow them off, and let go of stereotops [sic. ] -- types -- and be like, Oh, they're so anal. Oh, they cut themselves.  No. They can't bear with life, they can't cope with life. And it is pretty hard, if you ask me; and you should know. And you should -- you should know. Like, there's -- there's -- there's many of you out there, right now, on the earth, who can't deal with it. So they feel that to escape from it, they have to injure themselves. So, it's like relief. I don't know if you know what I mean. It feels good. . But it just like, to know that I know someone out there right now, or there is someone out there right now, that can't cope with life, that can't bear his life, and they feel that they just wanna die, and they -- their escape plan is to die. It not only hurts them, but they're affecting everybody around the world, because one person's pain is another person's pain. And so on it travels and echoes throughout the whole world. And I just thought I'd like to make that point out to all of you who -- Okay, so. Peace out YouTube. Oh, comment. Comment. And subscribe. That'd be cool. So, peace. I'll be seeing you guys later.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG172","﻿Hey guys. Um, so these past few days haven't been, um, the best, um, mainly because one of my friends, XXXX, he passed away on Monday. God, I don't even know if I should be making this right now. It's been pretty hard on all of us. It was especially hard for me 'cause -- I mean, I've never had anyone somewhat close to me die.I talked to him the night before 'til, like, midnight or something, and the funny thing was he just wouldn't stop complimenting me and -- and just -- he was just being so nice and I -- I just took everything for granted.It's really hard, because I never got to know him long enough, you know. I didn't have enough time to spend with him. We had all these plans to do all these different things and we'll never get to do them, you know what I mean? And he was my age, I mean -- it's way too young to die. In a short span of life I think he lived it up as much as he could, you know? When I was talking to him the night before , we made a plan to go on a date this weekend, but -- I'll just -- I'll be going to his funeral instead. He was going to go to fashion school. He had -- he had such a future. All he ever wanted to do was just see The Nutcracker. So it's been a tough couple few days, and my friends and I are getting by by helping each other, you know? So I just wanna say to all his family and friends who happen to watch this, um, my prayers are with you and him. Anyways, um, I'm sad because he was just the nicest guy you'll ever know.We'll all miss -- we'll all miss him a lot, very much. So yeah, sorry if I don't make any videos anytime soon. Life is not going so well right now, but we'll get by. Rest in peace, XXXX .

"VLOG173","Hello, YouTube. It's XXXX here. I just realized I haven't made, like, sort of, proper, talky, video thing in a while. Well then, like me and XXXX made some other ones, so you can go on her account to watch that. So I'm gonna put up mine, but, no; it takes so long to load, and basically.Uh, yeah, sorry about clown makeup, by the way. I was doing a thing for my friend's media, so I was like, I'm gonna put on lipstick, and I'll be like the next colorful person or something. And then it turned out that I was going to become so the whole, like, lipstick -- it didn't really work. But, , I dunno.But yeah, so, um, basically, I've -- I'm still alive and stuff and I'm making videos, which is cool. And, um, two things I wanted to chat about 'cause they are both serious matters. Okay, first of all, the Galaxy adverts, that, you know, Galaxy chocolate. All of those dumb adverts are just women like, I love my chocolate; I'm gonna eat a whole bar of it. Like, every single woman, it's like, ever made, I swear. Like, correct me if I'm wrong; maybe there's been one where a guy has been like, I fucking love Galaxy. But most of them, if not all of them, are just these chicks, like, hiding their chocolate so other chicks can't steal it. Like the most recent one, where these women like, I love books and I love chocolate. And it's like, girls don't just eat chocolate. Like, we're not just crazy onto chocolate. Sorry. dodgy. Girls don't like weird, fucking, gonna be like, yeah, chocolate. Like, I dunno, it's just stupid, fucking stereotype and it irritates me a little bit. So it's just like -- I dunno maybe I'm just making a fuss over nothing -- but it's kinda like, can we not with the whole constantly being chicks fucking eating chocolate on their own. It's like we are not such bad people, seriously.Also another thing, I'll find it, 'cause -- I don't remember the link. My mate showed me; then he was gonna show me something else and then he found that, so he was like, watch it. But it's some guy called, I dunno; his mate was called Cougarman , but I think he was called Big Man. But they did some version of, um, , but the Cougman guy had the right idea. He was taking the call and saying like, what the fuck is my mate doing? I think it was on . But, Big Man guy, he was like doing some version of Lady Gaga just dance, but it's just basically him being like, pull your pants down, suck my dick, mirror me, I've got all my bitches and I'm going to change women now. And it's like, honey, for real, like, just from what I've seen with the whole drug and he's not much of a looker -- it's, like, there's one bit where he's just like, um -- uh, bitch, get all fumbled, I'm gonna find another girl to suck my dick. But it's like, be happy with the one, and you don't need to sing about it. It's like, congrats' that you are getting some action. Yeah, I'm -- I'm pleased for you and all that, but don't kill Lady Gaga, please. Her music is good. I like it. I don't want you to piss all over it with your crap. Pretty much.Like, as bitchy as that sounds, like, I'm sure he's a lovely person in real life, but, like, seriously; don't put that crap on the internet. No one wants to see it. And rich, coming from me, 'cause I'm putting a video of me just talking on the internet. But I'm not being unasked, and I'm not killing a good song, so just leave it. But, um, yeah. So that's two things that I found annoying.And, um, anyone watching this who wants good music to listen to, they should check out the Millionaires. They're pretty fierce. Wait, I'll play a bit of them now actually. Wait, finding it. Yeah, so this is them. And they're really awesome, and, um, yeah, I like them. And you should listen to them 'cause they'e really cute, and it's all pretty fierce, but yeah. I think that's about it and, um, I dunno; that's about it. Also a big shout out to XXXX, because she's fabulous and just because I've been talking to her and stuff and she's cute. And, um, can't really think of anything else to talk about, to be honest.Apart from that thing with the Pope, chatting about how condoms is increased the AIDS epidemic or something, like, don't know what he's all about. Like, once again, I'm have nothing against the Pope himself; it's just the second time something he said has been kind of silly, to say the least. But yeah, Pope needs to sort his things out, 'cause now everyone's going to be like, oh, if condoms makes the whole getting AIDS chance higher; I'm not going to use one. Then tons of people are gonna get AIDS, all because of the Pope. So like, yeah, I don't know what he thinks he's doing. And then some crazy bitch was on some show chatting about how condoms make AIDS worse as well, and it's -- it's -- it's silly basically. Like, yeah, please get your facts straight before you chat about that kind of thing on TV.And, um, hmm, yeah, I don't think I have anything else to talk about actually. Sorry, this video, me being like , but I dunno. Um, gonna stop fighting that. Yeah, I think that's about it really. Yeah, it's all happy YouTubing, guys. I'll make a more interesting video next time.

"VLOG174","Welcome to blog number cinco. Number five of XXXX here today, to talk about my new glasses. Uh, this is a topic that may not interest most people, because it's not controversial, um, it's really not very interesting either, so I don't know why it would interest anyone, but this is what um, our board of two panelists decided that I was gonna talk about, so I just do what I'm told.Uh, basically what just happened is I went back in time from two thousand nine to nineteen fifty six by putting these glasses on, um, back to the ages when men were men and boys grew up to become men. Unlike today when boys will be boys is the model of our society. It was a proud time, a time of coal mining, hard hitting football players from places that mined coal. Uh, the good old days. I'm sure the Green Bay Packers were good at football, I don't know if Vince Lombardi was coaching, but good times, I really miss it, not that I was there for them.What else was happening? Oh, um, well, we must've been in the middle of the Cold War so that must've been kinda exciting, um, in our arms race with the Russians and our race to get to the moon which happened um, nineteen sixty four, something like that. I'm sure that was exciting, and people with glasses just like these, they designed those spaceships, they designed the computer systems. Maybe Neil Armstrong even wore glasses like this when he said, That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.  I don't know.Oh, and by the way, the moon landing was not fake, that's just a bunch of mumbo jumbo. I can't believe that people have the audacity to say that things like the lunar man -- landing and the Holocaust are fake -- never happened. That -- like especially the Holocaust, come on, that's six million people. Six million people massacred or some atrocious amount like that and you're trying to tell them that it didn't happen when they still have relatives today that are alive? Unreal. Can you be any more insensitive to these people? Just make me sick and I wanna throw up all over this web camera right now and just show you how disgusted I am by the fact that you would take away this historic event which -- just hide the atrocities so that we don't have to think about the atrocities of mankind and what they committed. I'm not saying that we should dwell on these, but to forget about them completely is worse than simply sitting around and not doing anything, because you're just gonna let it happen again. Um, because people won't know about it and they'll just become as intolerant and abusive of power as Adolf Hitler was. So as I was saying, got new glasses, hope you enjoy them as much as I do and uh, continue to rock. This is XXXX, vlogging off.","Low","Low","Low"

I was like eeeh.So, I'm going to open it. Find out what is inside. I know one of things, but it -- it feels thicker than I thought it would be. Oh geez, all kinds of little fun things in here. That's the look of a confused person. Okay, let's see.Oh, she told me she was writing a little letter. Thank you, you're adorable XXXX and I love you. She got me a Leakycon 2011 pen. She told me about that. Oh you know what, they were actually giving the -- ironically enough -- they were actually giving these booklets out to people, um, at Leakycon two thousand and nine, but now I have two. Oh, that's so fun. But wait, that makes me smile.And Bill's CD. Aww, I'm so excited. Bill is awesome. Ooh, hello CD. The little things inside broke, that's sad, that's why it popped out. That's okay, the case broke but the CD looks okay. Little piece of a case. And Bill signed it. I say I wish you could've come soon. Scribble. I'm pretty sure it says Bill Martin, but it -- it -- it looks like a little scribble. His -- his handwriting is a lot neater than Hank's is, though, so Bill wins on that front. The case broke, but the CD looks okay, that's okay. As long as the CD's okay, that's really the most important part.XXXX, thank you for this. That was really sweet of you, you're awesome and I love you. And I can't wait to listen to the CD and I have to find a good place for this pen, I don't know where. Gotta go somewhere though, 'cause I wanna be there. Aww, that was really sweet of you, thank you very much, you're adorable, thank you.

And, uh, it takes about eight to ten minutes to cook once it's at full boil so I was like eight to ten minutes? Seven Eleven is only three minutes away, I can do this.So you know, I go to Seven Eleven, I buy the product of choice which I was hoping would be milk but instead I grabbed this guy. This is another lesson in why I need to learn Japanese completely. It looks like milk, doesn't it, you got like white liquid pouring into glasses, yeah, it looks great. So I buy it, five hundred milliliters worth and I mix it with -- with the -- the cheese. Now the catch is that this is not milk, this is like sweet something and here's -- here's what I make of it. It says, uh, sheedoi which is white sheedoi, oisheedsa which I am assuming is like white deliciousness or something along those lines. New San king , so new San king, okay, could be milk. And then here in the yellow it says, cream cheese -- cream cheese. I did not bother to read that. So I guess it's not the fact that I couldn't read but that I was in a hurry to get back here and so I didn't read, and I just went by the pictures which is a bad choice. So what I got was sweet cream cheese juice which you know, is kind of good to drink, you know it's not bad, it sounds kind of nasty but it's all right so as a result I have instead of the average Annie's shells and real aged cheddar, I have sweet cream juice version of that. And, um, you know, I made a lot of it too. Ah. It's all right, it's -- it's kind of sweet, it's got this kind of funky side to it. You know, funky is good, so -- learn to read and be patient when trying to read. Peace.","High","High","High"

"VLOG179","Ah! , hey guys, so I'm glad to say that I'm home in Las Vegas, Nevada, visiting for the weekend. It feels awesome.And this is my doggie Lizzy , yeah, yeah Lizzy. She's named after me. Don't -- don't get it too wrong, opp, she cute, opp she's bangs, ah. Okay, so, let's catch you up on the DL. There's -- there's not too much going on, but I'm just excited to me home in Vegas. What are you doing? .I'm just so excited. Like, I was driving home and I got here in, like, three hours 'cause I was speeding. I was going, like, eighty five. That is kind of dangerous, in the dark, but I'm about to go to lunch with uh, some friends, Alex and Harrison . I'm excited to see them. And then I'm getting a massage and then, huh, it's -- I should go to my dinner.Yeah, she missed me. I missed her. It's been a long fricking time. But anyways I'm happy to be home. I just got to the chiropractor fixed my back because of all of my back problems and what not and then, whoo, she crazy. Crazy bananas.But a -- I -- I need to make cooler blogs. I don't know how to make blogs, so if you want to help me out -- I've been, like, researching trying to figure out better ways to make them, but I just, like, maybe I'm not that entertaining or something because I always thought that I was entertaining but then I look at other peoples and it's, like, they're twenty thousand times more entertaining and I got nothing. That's why I only get, like eighty, views. Eighty, that's, like, nothing.You guys better watch my videos. Watch my videos and subscribe to that pointy box over there. I think that's right, over there. And um, yes, so much stuff has been going on, it's insane.I am just awesome. That's all I have got to say, is that I'm just so awesome. Yeah, so I'm talking to a guy. That's all I'm going to say about that but he's pretty hot. But this weekend is going to be a blast. I'm probably going to blog but I just wanted to say how awesome it is to be home. Awesome, awesome. I say these words and I never stop saying them at all.I want to show you guys my room. Pink, there's a lot of pictures on my fitting bag over there, yeah, representing. I've got to do homework this weekend. Not too exciting, ahh.You -- so I'm picking up my bike. That's the main reason why I came down here so I could get up my bike and so I could go ride. So if you're in LA downtown and you ride a six gear call me because I need someone to ride with, please.All right, I'm going to edit this and put it on YouTube. Yeah, I'm bored. Before lunch, lahhh, we'll see. If you want my mouth, don't you? Don't you? Loo l'loo l'looo, you -- what are you looking at? What are you looking at?","High","High","Low"
"VLOG18","So, there was a bit of a gathering on Tuesday that I attended. Look,I took this picture, which means that I met The Jonado. That's over th-- conversation varied from the merits of presidential bodyguards to abandoned buildings in Detroit. So, yeah, that's how I met Lea -- sorry, Lea and David and Scott and Joe and Monica and Shelly and John and I'd like to give a final shout out before video completion. First of all, to the tag team duo of Brissy and Robert for making these awesome shirts and second of all, to Columbus Library Security for holding it down, because right before we went into the auditorium, there were these thirteen and fourteen year old girls sitting right outside the door. Just so you know, here's a layout of the hallway we were sitting in.Thank God, the security man came up to the girls and said, you girls make sure you don't block that elevator. Thank you, sir, for making the world a safer place to live in.So quick recap. I went to a gathering this week, which means I met XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX . The last three, I kind of met by chance.Back it up. So the gathering happened. Copters, copters. I asked this guy about XXXX. Do you know where XXXX is, at all? Friendly. XXXX talked.As you know, there's a tradition if you win the Nobel Prize, you give it all the charity, but no.We got stuffed signed. And then me and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX were standing outside the library, near the short sisters, XXXX and XXXX. That was when XXXX walked up and saw us standing near XXXX and XXXX. I guess he figured we were with them. And he asked, so where are we going? So the group walked to a nearby restaurant.","High","High","High"
"VLOG180","﻿I'm talking like this 'cause . This is for us to video. I don't know what that is. I don't know what to say. Think it's in the sidebar. Do you think we're going in the right direction? The reason I'm supporting -- I'm not quite sure really if what they're doing -- I mean -- is a charity. They're raising money, they call for donations. But I don't know if it's a charity. What I'm supporting is the uniform project. The woman who's doing the project dresses in the same dress every day. For three hundred sixty five days with different things around it. So in a way, everything but the dress is an accessory, even pants and tights. Everything is an accessory to that dress. This is basically her every day with the same dress as her black dress. I suck at this. This is what I get for not being prepared . Yeah, this is a model pose right there.Funds raised in the program go to the Kontra Foundation. It's for the education of children in India. So far they've raised enough money for one hundred eighteen kids to go to school. If you donate in December, eBay will match your donation up to fifteen thousand dollars for the dollar. So if you donate one hundred and fifty five dollars -- I'm pretty sure -- I mean -- eBay is also gonna donate one hundred and fifty five dollars. It's for a great cause. Kids definitely should go to school and raising money to help someone so they can go to school is just really fantastic, because even though a lot of people are like ugh, school, well you probably have a lot more opportunities now that you have gone to school or that you are going to school, and life is probably going to be a lot easier for you because you went to school. Just saying. It's not a fact. It's just an opinion, but helping these kids go to school will help them be able to achieve more greatness in life. And also decrease world's suck. And hey, who doesn't love decreasing the world's suck. I mean add more awesome to this world. And I think we're probably doing this wrong, but -- that's basically it. She um -- she -Look what I just found. Thing's monstrous.So even if you don't donate, just check it out.","Low","High","Low"
"VLOG181","So Mr. XXXX here got to experience old people driving for a day. Ah, so yesterday I had to go to the grandfather and XXXX, to go get a car, and my grandpa was chauffeuring us --- chauffeuring --- Chauffeuring us, see I can't even focus. I can't focus. Cha -- chauffeuring us to the, uh, little repair shop, and uh, so, we're half way there and everything's going okay and I'm all proud of him that we haven't killed anyone. We haven't run over any squirrels or dogs.-- But he almost broke the mirror off - he didn't even see that.Oh, we're going an' the -- the set up of the intersection is, like, there's a left hand turn lane that's going straight, and a right. And we're about fifty feet back --- okay, so there's no left hand turn lane yet, but my grandpa was like, alright, we're gonna make our own lane. So he goes on the left of the cars going up - so we're heading into oncoming traffic. And there are these cars pulling out of like, CVS and stuff, and we're going up and whatever and I'm just like oh my gosh, oh my God, oh my God. And there's this minivan that decides to do the same exact thing we did, that's right in front of us. So he starts to do that. We stop. Then there's this other car wanting to cut in front of us - it's an entire mess. My grandfather's like, ah, what's going on?Yeah, but you missed the fact that it was close.We -I mean that van pulled out like, like, a foot from --- I closed my eyes, I closed my eyes. I said holy shit, we're gonna die.This van was like, it was close, I mean, he pulled out like a foot in front of us.Uh, so uh, yeah, we -- we're squeezing on by and people are staring at us. There was an SUV that wanted to take a left in front of us and we were in their way and everything. And we finally get in the actually -- right -- we actually get in the left hand turn lane, finally, and all of a sudden -I love you --- Okay then it's time, like, the light's changing, and all these cars just blowing by us honking their horns, and not just like ar, ar, no, arrrrr, arrrrr. And the whole time, the whole time grandpa's got his head down, and like covered his face, and every car, it's like he can see in his face -- I actually heard him go oh my God -- and every car that goes by he's like, thinking is that it? Finally? And it's like one after another, there had to be like five cars just, and it's just like, from the back of the car all the way past it they're on the horn, each one of them. Every one, like -- arrrrrrrr, arrrrrrrr, you know one after another with the horn. And the oncoming cars were honking -Oh God, ah, and then the funniest thing is he just, he just blows the whole thing off. And we actually - our plan was to go to McDonald's to steal some internet and he goes oh, we missed McDonald's back there.That was so awkward he'd go I'll turn around cos you were like no.Oh my God.Ahh, yes so don't drive with old people.Unless you have your camera going.I did have the camera with me, but this all happened so fast that it was just like holy crap -So we bo you almost lost two bloggers that day.Yeah, we almost died.Well you'd have lived, I think. I think your grandpa and I, we were on the one side -Yeah, you guys were on the death side. I was on the okay I'll live.I'll crawl out the window.Uh oThat is horrible.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG182","Hey, YouTube. It's XXXX, and uh, before I get going on what I actually want to talk about, there is one thing I do want to talk about before that, and that is my return to YouTube. I am coming back. I am going to post as many views as I can. I have a couple of videos ready to be uploaded, and then yede, yede, blah, blah, blah. Um, yeah, so I need to do that and I will do it uh, this weekend, hopefully, and post those next week during my spring break, but that is not what I wanted to talk about.Now it isn't a matter of fact I am doing word accents, or about the fact that I am adjusting my laptop. Or about the fact that I moving, so I can grab what I wanted to talk about. What I wanted to talk about is this Pocky, but not the strawberry flavored Pocky, because I really don't like the strawberry flavored, uh. So um, big thanks to Kevin for, eh, running this part of my video, because, eh, I want to use the original flavor of Pocky for this, but all I have left is my strawberry because he stole the last three pieces of it today, so thanks. I hate you. And I really dislike the strawberry flavor. So, yeah. I am just gonna sit here and eat my crappy strawberry flavored Pocky. Wish I had some original flavored. Make me so mad sometimes.Uh, I been -- now that I am done sulking. Uh, so Pocky, if you don't know is -- it's kind of like a cookie in a way. It's kind of like -- yeah, it's like this. This is a strawberry flavored Pocky stick. Uh, they come in packages like this. You can actually buy them at, like, super Walmarts. I didn't know this until, like, yesterday. They're not -- why did I say yesterday? Um, I must be tired. Um, it's last Saturday because I had been looking for Pocky, like, forever and I could never find it and the only place I -- I mean, I spent three years looking for it and never found it until I went to a Borders, and, uh, they were selling it at this Borders, so I bought, like, a box, along with -- uh, where did it go -- this book. I love this book. Uh, it's full of little cats.Um, just looking through here. Where my cheese burger? Where my Pocky? Where's my original flavored Pocky, huh, huh? Yeah, XXXX, you owe me a box. Mm, I'm angry. Mm, I'm going to look through here and then -- what am I doing? I -- I'm doing a video, not -- not -- I'm sorry, I'm bored.So I went to this Borders and I bought that I Can Has Cheezeburger book, and um, some original flavored Pocky -- I bought one box of it, and it was amazing. And then it was, like, in January, I think. I spent months up -- this is like April. It wasn't until like March I found some again, and there was only, like, one box in Borders. I mean, last time I was there they had, like, one of the by stands and they had, like, a bunch of it on there. And then I went there and then I found this one box on a bottom shelf of -- in the monger section, which made me kind of -- made me kind of ma ad.I'm gonna talk in a weird accent like this for the rest of my video. Huh, it's kind of like an Australian accent in a way, sounds really weird. Anyways enough of the accent.Um, so I was kind of mad about that because I had been waiting months and months and months and months to get up to this Borders again to buy some Pocky and I only got the one box. And they didn't have any more, so I was, like, okay, I'll just come some other time and get some.And so I went to Walmart and we're going down on the Asian cuisi -- cuisi -- cuisine -- is that even a word, cuisine, cuisine? Yeah, Asian cuisine section and I looked down, like, oh my God, is that -- why is there Pocky here? They had, like, one of those, you know, little box deals. I don't know, I can't really do it, my webcam doesn't let me do that kind of stuff. Uh, it was, like, one of those little box sleigh deals and it was full of Pocky. I'm, like, oh my God. So I bought, like, a bunch of Po -- a few boxes of the original flavor, so I had, like, four of the original and I got one box of strawberry. I really don't like the strawberry that well. It takes like a cross between strawberry yogurt and strawberry ice cream. It's not that I don't mind strawberry ice cream, it just doesn't taste good when it's on Pocky.So I was kind of, like, mad today when I lost the last three pieces of my Pocky. So now I gotta buy some more original flavor. And I was looking up on Wikipedia and they actually have some really weird flavors, which is, like uh, honey, grape, um, tangerine, five fusion berry -- whatever that is -- banana, coffee, caramel, marble royal milk tea -- whatever that is -- melon milk, honey and mi -- what? Uh, why is -- oh, honey and milk. I was gonna say -- uh, cream cheese, berry, sweet potato, crush -- which is like crunchy cracker pieces in the chocolate -- pineapple, pumpkin, hazelnut, um, soy bean flour, Brazilian pudding, blueberry and green tea. Those are some of the weird flavors that I have not seen ever.And if I did this when I was reading, that is because of my eyes. They are strange like that. I -- kind of do this when I am reading sometimes, I don't know why. I just do it. But yeah um, so you can buy these at, like -- like, super Walmarts in the Asian cuisine aisle. They are like a dollar thirty -- no, no, they are not a dollar thirty three. They are a dollar nine at Walmart. They are a dollar thirty three at like Borders, so, yeah.So a big thanks to XXXX for ruining this video for me. Thanks a lot, XXXX. Uh, so yeah, that should be it. Oh my, what is -- what's that? What's that?It's not full; it's always been not full. . It's always been more slow.","Low","High","Low"
"VLOG183","Hello everyone, and welcome to Wednesday; Thursday. Hello everybody, and welcome to Thursday.So, this is . Uh, see, it -- it's getting a little better. It -- it's looking real good. Before it was just like, it was fat, but it looks good now. And my name is, uh -- has become a lot more of a conversational piece because people actually look at it now. Uh, because before when I said my name, it was just like I said it and nobody really asked me any questions, 'cause it wasn't on the table, sort of thing. So now, everyone of my the tables asks me the question, Oh, is that XXXX?  I'm like -- sometimes I just just say, yeah. If I'm XXXX, my name is XXXX. It's XXXX. Doesn't matter .Got rid of this desk in my room, so my room is bigger now; and now I have just one big desk. Oh, yeah. My room is bigger now, because I have a small room to begin with. I began to notice recently that I've been contracting a -- an obsession to ties, as, um, I bought five more ties. They just look so cool, but it's the only part of my uniform that's different than everybody else's, and I like to have -- like having a good amount of ties. I finally conjured enough money to go and buy Farm Worker Two. I'm gonna go do that as soon as I'm done making this video, um, because I had to return it four days ago, and now I'm having withdrawal from the video game. So I need to go make a purchase.Today is the sixteenth of December, which leaves only nine days before Christmas. And, um, I was thinking should not buy people things for Christmas. They should just buy people gift cards or things, or just give people money. Because the value of your money is ten times better after Christmas anyways. So what's the point of spending more before? Just, like, two or three days; you just might as well wait.So I went to work the other day, and there's like two forty year old women and their two sixteen year old sons. And both of the women were drunk. They had just been drinking wine, since they -- they were on the wait to be sat at a table. They're sitting at the bar drinking, and then when they got to my table, they'd had -- don't you love just finding things in your mouth, like -- they're uh -- they're drinking their wine, and, um, Do you all -- do you 'all like nuts?  Because I wasn't going to talk about the desert, but nuts isn't like nuts. The lady goes, Well, are you talking about the nuts on the food?  And I was just like, did this lady really just say this to me? And her sixteen year old son is like, Mom, that is so inappropriate.  And then I said, That's what I was thinking.  But then I proceeded to telling her that I thought it was funny that she had said that, because it was really off the wall, I was not expecting her to make a joke about my nuts. But that shows people for you when they're drunk.On that note, I'm going to see you all later, maybe this week, if I decide to make a video, um. Bye.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG184","That's the reason, why do I try to speak out, girl like no know one could hear me. I want to belong here, but something is still so wrong here.Hello, YouTube. Oh boy, has a lot has happened since I made my last video. If you follow my videos you all ready by now be able to tell that this is another background then the one I've usually got in my videos and there's one very simple reason to that I moved --- Grew up in a small town and when the rain would fall down I'd just stair out my window. Dream what love could -'Til I touch the sky. Make a wish, take a chance, make a change and break away.Right. That was a little montage of clips and photos that I took while we were moving and I just really wanted to use that song as a background because I think it's quite fitting.Anyway I'm here now and I officially don't live at home anymore. I left Lemme , the second biggest city of Denmark and I live here with my sister, the wonderful Marie . And I would give you a tour of our apartment, but there's still some moving mess around. I've got box down there and the kitchen still need some work and Marie's room isn't done at all, so that will have to wait.And the reason behind my move is that I'm going to start attending university in September and in Denmark you start university on September the first and you get your acceptance letter from the university on July the thirteenth. So yeah, that means that today I got my acceptance letter. This is the letter. And if you don't understand Danish then here it says and that means I'm accepted to university.So as of September the first, I'm going to be studying political science. Yeah, I know that some may think that that sounds boring, but I'm really hope that it isn't because that was my favorite subject in high school and so, yeah.All right, so I have covered my move and my acceptance letter, but those two are the only new things that has happened in my life. I also got a job. And actually I wasn't planning on getting a job at all, but then my sister in law has a sister in law, I know that sounds silly, and she recommended me for a cleaning job at a hospital that's just near by so I couldn't really say no because it pays pretty okay and it's only every third weekend and I could use the money.Moving, acceptance letter, getting a job, I got a fourth thing too. I got a niece and I haven't seen her yet, but I'm going to tomorrow and I have only seen a little picture of her and -- that I have got on my cell phone. And yay, now I have got two nephews and one niece and I think that it's just perfect.So as you can understand, my life has been eventful these past days and yeah, I think I'm happy.Oh, as a fifth thing that has happened I have cut my bangs. I've got a bad habit of cutting my own hair and it just ends up looking ridiculous. So, I don't like my hair right now, but I have time to cut it before school starts.","High","High","High"
"VLOG186","﻿Sensor all books, point at things! So summer is here, most people that means, you know, like relaxing and having fun. No, I have to get another job. I am pretty much like a UPS man now. A lot of you had had me on MySpace, probably like three hundred of you or so 'cause I know I don't know most of MySpace friends, but I guess MySpace is this new IM thing that automatically appears in front of my screen. So if you want to, I'm always on MySpace and it always startles me when people just randomly, bading din, message me but I will always talk back, always. So feel free to message me. Obviously, I don't go to school. So what else am I going to do? MySpace. If you noticed, the fish tank noise is gone because I just filled up my fish tank for you. Don't thank me or anything, whatever. Last time I did make a video, I had six hundred sixty six subscribers. I know, creepy, and I now have nine hundred sixty seven, so that's, uh, three hundred and one more. So welcome, this is pretty much all I do. And after that statement, I am back to six hundred sixty six.So I want to talk about Swine Flu, an epidemic that is just all over the country. People are dying left and right. The Mexican baby died, you know. I know it is not super huge in the media, the newspapers and everything like it was maybe two weeks ago, but I didn't make a video two weeks ago -- so, today is two weeks ago. Well, just in case you might think that you have Swine Flu, I am going to put a link in the sidebar, I'm don't know which way it is -- a link in the sidebar that you can click on and see if you have Swine Flu. This has concerned me ever since I was a child, um -- would somebody please tell me if they have a tongue like I do? That only looked incredibly retarded but, uh, yeah, I have like, a little crease in it -- and it -- and I don't know why.So the new Star Trek movie came out like what, two weeks ago, a week and a-half ago, I have seen four times. More importantly, the movie is incredible and if you haven't seen it you should go see it. It is really, really good. Olson -- he's the one who goes down to blow up the thing, sorry if I am spoiling it. Anyway he has the red shirt. He dies. I thought that it was really cool that they put that in there.Most of the comments that I get on my videos are really, you know, favorable and then I get some bad ones but comments -- I read all of them by the way -- um, comments that I get that are like, I can't believe that you don't have a boyfriend and the blah, b blah, b blah, b blah. It's because I want a girlfriend. I'm kidding, no. It's my personality that -- I have tried my entire life -- and I'm in a wheelchair-- to be caller number nine or six or one through eighty, but I never get anywhere. I finally won tickets. And guess what I won tickets to? The beard and mustache world championship -- I think that I am going to die alone with cats and a bunch of you are too, so don't feel bad for me. Everybody loves a cat -- I'll still go. I don't even care. I'll go. So yeah, there's hope for you. So go out there and find someone, and if that person you have to gag and just throw into your van and to get, you know what things have to be done. You have to take chances. In, like, criminal record sort of chances.Another trend that is no longer a trend but since I haven't made a video, I'll talk about it. Is whatever her name is, large lady using things very well -- Britain's Got Talent. I don't care. I am sick to death listening to people say, oh, oh, she can sing so well, blah, b blah, b blah, but really, just because she is ugly we are suddenly going to talk about her? I mean come on, ugly people have skills too, you know, if anything we're demeaning her by saying she shouldn't be able to sing because she's ugly. It is a horrible stare -- I mean, if we say that we might as well say, oh, she can walk? I didn't know that ugly people can walk. Did that girl just graduate high school? She's ugly; I didn't know that ugly people knew anything. In fact let's broaden that, any reality show, period. I don't care about. They are people -- in fact I see repeat people. People who would be on one reality show and then would be on another reality show that is completely unconnected. These people are probably just actors that are trying to get their name out there and here they are acting like they are human beings. Actors are not human beings. Look at Tom Cruise.Some kids at school have been giving me crap about having a YouTube account and they are probably watching this, get Reese who ever else. Anyway, they say everybody who watches me is a total perv and I would like to disagree. Only like seventy eight percent of them are total pervs. So, what is that? Seventy eight, so twnety -- twenty two percent are, you know nice people. And I bet all of that twenty two percent is watching right now and I bet that seventy eight percent is just unsubscribing or staring at my chest. I don't know. I don't know but it's happening right now.Another little weird thing is that I won tickets on the radio. You call in and you win things. I have tried my entire life to call in and be caller number nine or six or one eighty, but I never get it. Well I finally won tickets, and guess what I won tickets to? The beard and mustache world championship. I'll still go. I don't even care. I'll go.","High","High","High"
"VLOG187","The fuck how I -- uch. I look orange. I do not wash to be orange, thank you, magic computer. I do not want to be orange. How do I change the fucking -- whatever. Technology is such a fucking nuisance. I hate it. I don't want to be fucking orange. Oh, damn you. I look , if I may say so. Oh, look at my lovely nails. Lovely nails.Um, I'm going out for the first time, like, in a million fucking years. Um, so um, I'm going to try and bring my camera along not forget and, like, possibly you shall all be invited to come with me. Possibly, possibly. We shall see, we shall see. Um, so there's no light, but that's okay. Um, whatever, whatever.So basically, I didn't make a video yesterday 'cause I was, like, fuck this, and nothing's really going on lately, which is kind of awesome. Um, honestly, this -- I'm loving this whole, like, how there's, like, no structure anymore. This is what I've always um, seen for this channel. I never really was so big on the whole five awesome trys -- five days. One day for each person and one post on their day and so much blah la la -- I think I'd rather just post when feel like it and when they actually have things to say 'cause otherwise you just get A, people sitting there with nothing to talk about or people who just don't post. Yes. I would never obviously do such things, but other people might. Possibly, maybe.Um, you like my rings? I bought -- I bought th -- this one when I was in New York. I quite enjoy the lady. Lovely rose ring. This one was two dollars and it turns my finger green which is lovely, lovely. Yeah, I like -- okay, I'm going to stop my post. Pimping myself out on the internet. Um, I'm really upset that I'm orange, though.Okay, so I just spent two minutes talking about what might upset my friends. Um, whatever. There's nothing to talk about. Um, yeah, I basically, like, I'm about to go out and I just, like, was, like, well I'll use my video, so I'm going to turn on the camera and -- and have a uh, extreme consciousness as it were. Um, I'm really enjoying all of these massive, massive, massive long videos.Um, yeah. Lady, Rosie and -- and Jonathan . I was quite amused -- quite, quite amused, by your, sort of, slow decline into nonsensical myth. Well, no, you made sense. It was just more, like, I mean, it's just got very creative or something. It was kind of cool to watch. Like -- like, have it documented um, and such, yes. As someone who doesn't really drink or smoke or do anything like that, but, um, yeah. So, yeah. This is basically the most fascinating three minutes of your life. Don't fucking even lie about it.Um, oh so, New York. That's what I should talk about. So, yeah. Um, uch, strange, strange times, strange times. Seeing my family again for, like, ages -- oh fuck, there goes my thing. Kind of weird, um, but, like, what the hell? I got a free trip to New York, so that's good. Um, can you see a little -- no, you can't.It's so hard to tell, when you're doing make up, like, what's going to look really, really subtle even when it looks really glaring and dramatic when you're this far away from the mirror and you're doing it to yourself. Yes, and so, um, I have, like, a little glitter eye liner. That's what I was talking about. So, whatever. Um, yeah. Ew, I look so fat, what the fuck? Oof, maybe it's my hair. I need to cut it. Oh my God, stop fucking talking about your fucking appearance. Gee whiz, I'm pissing myself off.Um, oh yeah. So I was um, kind of um, I'm -- I'm very bad at documenting things. I'm one of those irritating people who brings a camera and then doesn't turn it on ever. So I -- I want really wanted to make a video with my sister when I was in New York, but I didn't end up doing it. Um, partly because I just was preoccupied with other things that was going on and partly 'cause, like, she doesn't even know what channel, so I'm kind of, like, um.Yeah, I told one friend about it, like, a couple months in and then, like, she stopped watching it a while ago. I was, like, oh, great, thanks. So, yeah, apparently um, assuming she doesn't watch it then nobody knows about anymore. Which I like. Otherwise I'd feel kind of, like, censored and weird, yes.Um, I'm sorry. I'm just, like, really obsessed with this, like, silvery pearl colored nail polish. I think it's really, really pretty. Yes, quite enjoys it. Um, wow, I'm in a conceited mood apparently, apparently, apparently. Um, so um, yeah.Um, so yeah, anyway, so I -- I, like, have a couple -- I might try to throw some stuff together from New York, but I didn't really record anything. I have a couple pictures . Also a picture of my sister, like, her um, her -- her graduation. Um, and that's about all I had so I don't really have anything for you guys. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Well, obviously it wasn't a very exciting trip. It was basically, like, weirdness. Basically I just wanted to see my sister again and kind of reconnect with her 'cause, like, she's really the only person in my family that has still any kind of contact with and I was kind of, like, not really. If I need to cut you out of my life, so that's fine, but I just need to, like, know if that's what's going on or if I should still, like, wait for you or whatever. 'Cause it was just all very confusing. She graduates high school this year. It's a very kind of schmaltish time, I suppose, so I'm just going hang around and see, like, what she's going to do. Shop and lovely sorts of things. It's all a bit up in the air, but um, yeah. It's kind of a -- she might come out -- come out east to somewhere near where I am, but she's staying in Vancouver apparently. Um, but that's fine. Um, yeah. Family, actually devil, you. Deffers.Ouch. Um, yeah. Oh, it was my birthday, too. Wait, I don't think I want to say that, but apparently, I just did, so. It was my birthday on the second which was Tuesday, I believe. Tuesday. Um, I did very, very little; as little as possible. It was my roommate's birthday the day before and so I was, like, drinking with them and I don't really do partying two days in a row which is good so I done with drinking.'Kay, this is just going downward, so I'm going to, like, go now. Um, but yeah, hopefully you'll appreciate that I'm, like, put something on 'cause I feel bad. I -- I don't know. Feels like there's nothing really -- yeah.Oh, I'm finally done in school, too. I had my last exam on Thursday of last week, so I'm finally done in school 'cause it's summer. I might take summer school, but we'll see. We'll see, we'll see, we'll see.Okay, I'm going to go now 'cause I'm just boring everyone. So, goodbye and -- and yes, comment please.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG189","﻿Hey guys, it's XXXX. I know it's been a while since I updated. I'm sorry, I have just been so, so busy. Um, I think I mentioned in my last post that my company is going through a system conversion, and that's been not a nightmare, but just -- just extremely busy. I'm working twelve hour days and it's been, um -- it's been torture. But, I've been making it through. Um, this year my daughter also started high school, so I've been very busy, um, with her as well. But, everything's going good, you know.Um, let's see -- as far as my update, you just say me weighing myself in. So as of today, September thirteenth, I weigh two seventy one. Um, so that's a total of forty four pounds lost. Um, I'm extremely happy with that. Um, September ninth I celebrated my three months, um, since getting the on June ninth. And, so that's forty four pounds in three months, so that's pretty good and I'm happy with that.Um, let's see -- as far as what size I wear, I was wearing a twenty four. Now I'm a solid twenty, but I -- I am getting into some eighteens, um, depends on where I buy 'em from. Ashley Stuart I could wear an eighteen lean brown, I can an eighteen. Entorit , I still wear a twenty. I'm still pretty top heavy. I'm still pretty wide across here, so I'm still wearing an eighteen twenty. Um, you know twenty shirts up here, but my bottoms are getting, um -- are getting smaller. So, um, I need to really start focusing on upper body exercises. I do a lot of cardio, but the cardio is really working on my lower body so, um, need to concentrate on that.Anyway, um, I got my second fill on September fourth, and now I have good restriction. I, uh, let's see -- I have fourteen cc van , and on my first fill I got three ccs put in, and it didn't give me much restriction. So, I noticed that kind of right away as soon as I started eating solid food. So I made an appointment to get another fill, and that fill happened on Sep four. So, um, he added two ccs, and so that made a total of five. And I actually felt it tightening up. It felt like a little mild stinging heartburn. And I was like, wow, I didn't feel the first one -- this is weird, you know. Um, so I went out to the waiting room and started sipping on some water and got a lot of pressure in my chest, and a lot of hiccups -- I mean it was terrible, all for a sip of water. So I knew it was too tight and, um, it's funny because I actually knew it was too tight based off what I've heard people here on YouTube and on, um, the Obesity Help Board mention -- how you feel when you're too tight. And so I knew right away and, um, I told them -- hey it's too tight, you gotta take some out. So he took out one cc. So, it's funny because three ccs didn't do anything for me and five was too much. So now I have four ccs and it's perfect restriction.Um, and because I have good restriction, now I'm really concentrating on only eating good stuff. Because, since my portion size has, um, significantly decreased, I can only, um, take in so much. I have to make sure that those are good foods for me. So this last week and a half since I got my fill -- pretty much only meats and vegetables. And I do like a grilled chicken pattie, maybe half of that. And um, uh, maybe a fourth of a cup of vegetables and I'm good. Um, it's funny though because what I have to do, um -- I'm sorry, go back to that. Chicken and vegetables and that's it. I don't eat any kind of carbs. No pasta, no rice, no sugars. Um, I do eat some fruits, but that is pretty much about it. I don't have time for anything else. If I get in the mood to eat something, it's gonna have to be, you know, a piece of lunch meat or something like that -- something that's gonna give me some kind of vitamin or some kind of protein. I don't waste my time with anything else. Um, I'm still working on drinking my calories, though, because I do drink a lot of teas and lemonades and things like that, and I need to get rid of that.Um, one thing I have noticed, though, that I need to get my brain to start appreciating, let's say, is the fact that the full sensation you get with the lap band is not necessary a satisfying full feeling. Um, before when you had hunger and you would eat something you weren't hungry anymore, it was a satisfying -- okay, finally I ate, I'm good. The lap band -- it's kind of just a red light or indicator that you need to stop eating, because it fills you up, it fills that pouch and if you eat anymore, you're gonna have a lot of pain. So, it's kind of like one of those -- like I said, stoplights, but it's not a satisfying, like, pleasurable feeling. It's kind of uncomfortable -- not extremely painful, but just a little uncomfortable. So, um, before you eat too much to get it painful, like I said, just stop and push away from the plate. Um, so because I know that the weight is coming and the lap band is actually working for me, I'm trying to get my mind to appreciate that feeling and not search for that satisfying, you know, bottom of the stomach, you know, feeling.Uh, my head hunger is getting better. Um, I don't graze but, um, when I do feel the need to want to munch on something, I will grab, um, some fruit or a little thing of apple sauce or some sugar free jello or something like that. Um, I just don't grab the bad stuff anymore. Um, I do Baby Bell -- little cheeses and stuff like that. That tends to help. Again, anything that has protein in it, I'll go ahead and do it.Um, let's see. I mentioned that I was an -- size twenty, size eighteen, so I'm gonna back up and let you see my new size eighteen skinny leg jeans in a second. But before I do that, I want to tell you guys, um, I think I showed in an early, early video um, the Special K protein water -- the little bottles. They now have the little mix in packets, and you get ten packets in here for the same price of getting, I think, four or six pre made bottles. So it's better cost savings, um, for this, and they're really cool. Um, so I actually hadn't had the pink lemonade. I think I may try it tonight. Um, but, yeah, they're pretty good. Got it at Walmart so, um, yeah, there you go.Anyway, so that's the gist of my update. I'm gonna back up now so you can see new in my new jeans and um, you guys take care of yourself. I'll talk to y'all later.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG19","﻿Hi everybody. I am showing you my answering machine blinking, because I wanted to show you that this is what my brain sees. Sorry I wasn't looking at you. That makes me have seizures. My brain's not aware of all that blinking, but I mean my conscious is not aware of it, but my brain is and that messes up the wires and makes me have seizures.All your brains will do that. The TV will do it to you. Flourescent lights will do it to you. The computer will do it to you. And if you ever found yourself feeling kind of, I don't know, really yucky, after you get off a whole day on the computer -- I know some of you do that, that's why -- because of that blinking. Especially blinking a lot faster than what you saw, but nevertheless, that's what causes my seizures and now you all might understand better why I don't get on the computer that much.I love you all, have a happy Thanksgiving.

"VLOG190","Hey there. You see I get haunted and a certain thing was stopping my door from opening and I thought I would never get into the house, but it's all, like, it hit and it went dunk and it hit -- hit something that was blocking it between the wall.Third doubt, the package included this T shirt I'm wearing. Oh yeah, this machine pose news and this CD by Hank Green . Hoh, hoh, square and nerdy just how we like it. The CD is -- was in my computer. Hank Green; the song, . This isn't Hogwarts.Somewhere out, go fish, I know mules are so half ass, , protons and neutrons, dead boys girlfriend, demolition derby, fathers of the family fathers, , Jesus gets nothing for Christmas, vegetables and it all makes senses in the end.As well as a T shirt I preordered, I got signed pick, yeah tha -- tha -- tha -- that is one hundred percent Hank's signature. Yeah, it can go with my other pick. In fact I am going to introduce my picks as friends now. You know I love it.I have seemed to miss placed my wallet. And it must have contained my pick ah, ah, wallet and spoon. All right, okay. Introducing picks into a new habitat. Do do do do do, Offspring pick meet Hank pick. Hank pick, Offspring pick, like each other. I now have a total of three picks, one of them I seem to can't find. eh, ha yeah, I mean yeah, it's Hank's signed. I mean tha -- tha -- that's, like, Hank Green's his signature right there. And last but certainly not least -- why am I speaking Russian? Or Russian accent anyway. Whatever. We have a -- oh no wait that's how I say it. We have a haaaa, poster of Hank with Shark Eyed Jones art on the back along with lyrics. Well, you know I've been doing a lot of magic tricks recently. I want to try one with you guys. So, see look, you know, it's a Hank poster, a Hank poster. I mean, I have -- I have Hank on my wall now.Right, well, on a slightly sadder note, I'm leaving YouTube. Not permanently, don't worry; just this channel. But I want to do -- this is going to be my last video on this channel and then I'm -- I'm going to make a new channel 'cause of all the haters. This channel, it could get watched it could get commented. I'm going to put all of them to my spam e mail address, so I will never know. This channel is going to sit here and die while a new channel will rise up. I will continue in the XXX , I'm still going to be a XXXX, XXXX; I'm still part of that. I'm still going to do everything with XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and everyone. I'm just going under a new name 'cause I'm sick of the haters because I'm allowed to have and opinion. I'm still a person. I maybe only 14, but that still makes me a legal person. I might not be and adult, still I say person, so you know. For all the people that matter, I'm going tell you my new channel. Most of them, I'll see you at school, but you know? I've got -- ah, if you want my new channel just hear me. I -- I'll still be using this one for another two weeks for that kind of stuff, but most of the people I'm just going to send it out to my subscribers and uh, my friends, people at school, people who watch me, you know? I'm not going to put any links to my new channel in this one because all of the haters will just swing to there. I'm just sick of it. I'm just sick of the haters. I mean, so what if I write on Twilight. I don't like it. Although I'm going to see the film, the new one, because I don't want people to say, ah, stop judging it before you've seen it. I'm going to see it and then I'm going to judge it. Okay? I'm going to see it. So you know it, this is the end. is dead as of this moment.","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG191","﻿Hey, everybody. So um, pardon my appearance right now. It is actually freezing. Freezing, freezing, on top of freezing. I don't know if there's a cold front coming in or something like that, but it is cold. So I've decided to be safe and to wrap myself up, kinda like a burrito type thing and not come out unless absolutely necessary.But -- oh, sorry, adjust my -- my burrito. Um, I just received another comment and I know I had made videos about this a long time ago, but I guess it's best to do it again since I don't know when I'll be able to reload those videos and it's about dating in Japan. And of course dating in any country is something that can be complex or, I don't know -- into it especially a lot of young ladies that would like to come to Japan and would like to date. I mean, that's understandable. You're in a new country, why not?But, um, one of the questions that came up that was sent to me yesterday was talking about the difference between Japanese men and Western men and whether I've dated a Japanese guy before and what did I notice in differences when dating Japanese men. And I can't really answer that question. I've only dated one Japanese guy and that didn't work out and it was more personality differences than anything else and so that -- that happens with anyone.But from the women that I know that do date Japanese men and have been here a lot and very, very clear about the differences between Japanese men and Western men is affection. And I know in animes and in dramas and things like that you see -- you see an overwhelming amount of affection and you're like, oh, it's so cool, it's so dreamy, da da da da da. But regular Japanese guys aren't really like that, and for a Japanese guy that I do know, just talking about basic -- like, complimenting their girlfriends doesn't happen very often.Um, but with younger people now you'll see them holding hands and things like that, where you wouldn't see that before. So society is changing in that way when it comes to affection but that's something that's been very clear.Even when I dated um, a Japanese guy it was not as common to be complimented by him or to have, you know, that kind of affection, to be hugged, to be, um, admired, and things like that. And I'm not saying that Japanese men don't do it. I'm not. And even older women that I've talked to in my office, especially, um, because Bobby has come and he's visited and he is just a really friendly and affectionate guy, and I remember one day I was talking to my co worker and I was, like, Bobby called me a full time job. He said he has two full time jobs -- me and his nine to five. And so I was -- I was laughing to myself and then one of my co workers had said she wishes that her husband would say stuff like that, because Japanese men don't usually compliment, uh, Japanese women. Um, whether it be their style or their character or things like that, it's just not as common a thing. And for the women that she knows that date American men or European men or men from just other places in general, uh, she said that it's just not as common. And she wishes that her husband would -- would say things like that, but then she wouldn't know how to react because she's so accustomed to not hearing those kinds of things.And um, not to discourage anyone because you date who you want to, but finding um, a boyfriend or girlfriend -- actually, no, let me say a boyfriend because it's -- I've noticed that it's a lot easier for guys to find a girlfriend -- a Japanese girlfriend -- than it is for girls to find a Japanese boyfriend. But it is what it is and it depends on where you are, it depends on what your personality is like, but don't be discouraged. If you'd like to date while you're here, by all means. I encourage you to go out there and watch. Go places and watch how they interact with each other because that will tell you a lot about what exactly it is you're up against.And on top of that, you have to figure out what exactly you want before you go dating anybody, because if you don't know what you want then you're liable to fall for the okeydoke and you don't want to do that anywhere in life, anywhere, it doesn't matter where you are. So figure out what you want, what you don't want, and just watch. It may take a long time to find someone, but you never know. You might come across the love of your life or you might come across an experience that, you know, sets you up to find whoever it is that you're looking for later on.So yeah, I am reporting from under the -- the covers and I bought a heated blanket so I'm not freezing and I'm about to cover my head up and go to bed. So, I go to bed. It's a little early. What is it -- it's not even five o'clock yet. But it's cold, and I'm getting back under the covers.So I will see you all later.","Low","High","High"

And I had to pretend that I wasn't insane when I quite clearly am. So, it was fun, awkward, really awkward.

"VLOG193","﻿This is Sunday, the twenty first of December. Yes, and I'm really sorry I haven't been away -- around for a really long time. I really don't have any decent excuse for not being so, other than that I've had a lot what to do. I don't anymore because it's my Christmas holidays, which is lovely. And my teacher has been clipping me in because some of us are doing retakes next year, just in January, so they're giving us some time to do all our revision. And we're taking one English exam on Pride and Prejudice from last year and I'm doing a new English exam on The Rape of the Lock and She Stoops to Conquer. So I'm doing a lot of revision for that. And I've got one essay to do. So it's not that much, which is nice.Um, I briefly mentioned in my video yesterday that I received two investee offers: one from Sussex, and one from Kent. Sussex I didn't expect them to want three A's for definite, especially since I'm not predicting three A's and um but I'm not too bothered because I didn't really want to go to Sussex. So, um, yeah. Not that bothered by it. But I did get an offer from Kent, and they want only three hundred and twenty points, which is the equivalent of an A and two B's and they didn't want any in English, which is I think might be doable, which is quite encouraging. The only problem would be that if I don't receive any more offers, um, well I'd have to put Sussex as my first choice, because you shouldn't have a second choice which one's higher grades than your first. Your insurance choice should always be lower. So it all can get quite confusing but, um, hopefully I'll hear back from some other universities fairly soon. That would be nice, but I don't expect it as it's the Christmas holidays now.Speaking of which, I haven't been feeling that Christmassy. I'm beginning to feel more so now, 'cause I keep hearing Christmas music and I think not hearing it for a few days has been a nice break and is actually giving me a lot of Christmas spirit and, um, I did briefly go to Buthland Abbey with my family today, very briefly. But this is the very lovely barn with the huge Christmas tree. I really don't have very much else to say today. So you should see me on Friday, which is the day after Christmas day. Happy Christmas everyone.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG194","Hey, guys. It's XXXX -- um -- I know I say this in, like, every video, but I apologize for my appearance. Um -- my hair looks like a hot mess. I just realized that. Yeah -- um -- I was just gonna say, like, my appearance because I'm not wearing makeup but apparently my hair looks disgusting too. Um -- I'm getting -- well my mom cuts my hair 'cause she's fabulous. Um -- so she's chopping off, like, two or three inches tomorrow. Because as you could see it's at a very awkward length and I can't really do much with it because usually when it's, like, shorter I can scrunch it in there's this, like, fabulous wave thing and it's, like woah tototo . Or if I sleep on it wet it, like, curls and stuff -- yeah. Anyways, so I kind of, like, straightened it last night and then slept on it and my hair looks, like, so terrible. Anyways, um, whenever I'm not wearing makeup I just have on moisturizer which is why my skin looks kind of dull. I didn't put on concealer or anything -- I'm not putting concealer or all this stuff whatever. Um, I don't have one, like, micro mineral foundation. So, um, that's, like, kind of -- like -- weird.Um, just wanted to kind of update you guys on some stuff though. First of all, in case you didn't know I'm having a contest so you should go enter it. Um, I don't have the prizes yet but -- well I have some of them. But I want to make a video when I have every single prize. Um -- what else? Yeah, like, I'm gonna make a video when I have all the prizes that's why -- I think that's why I only have like one entry so far. Thank you for entering by the way. And thank you in advance to all the people who do enter. Because usually, like, with my last one I only had, like, a couple entries and then when I started showing prizes I would start getting more entries. And I had, like, over thirty entries with one hundred subscribers. So I was like okay how ya doing. So, um, yeah. Pretty much I, um, still have to go get it. Just because I was focusing all my money on getting Christmas presents for my family and stuff. So, um, I'll have more money after Christmas when I start babysitting again and stuff. 'cause I babysit for this family, like, on a regular basis and they said they're gonna need me, like, a week after Christmas. So, like, next week. So they're like yeah, we're gonna need you like a week after Christmas. They didn't know the exact date but they knew that they're gonna need me. So, yeah, I'll have money and then I'll go out and, um, buy prizes for the contest. Hey. Um, it is really like mostly drug store stuff. I'm not gonna go out and be like so I bought like twelve mineralized skin finishes and five thousand MAC blushes and stuff because I don't have that kind of money. I am a seventeen year old girl with, like -- well not that being a girl has anything to do with it -- whatever. I am a seventeen year old who does not have a job because I am focusing on school.My job is, like, babysitting and then I'm opening up my Etsy soon now that I can actually sew again because I can use my thumb. So, um, I actually went to the craft store today and -- with my mother. And got some sewing machine needles -- five -- so that's plenty of -- um -- needles fixed up. And then I got some colored feathers with, like, spots on them. And you can't even see them in here they just look really dull but I'll open them up and show you guys one of them. Hi. I'm sure that's sanitary. Everybody wants to buy them now. Um -- I'll show you one of them. Hey, here's what I could make since I'm gonna be a hot guy next year. Oh. Oh. That's when I'd really, like, apathetic -- whatever. So it's, like, they have, like, these awesome, like, feathers polka dot things. So I'm gonna be putting them onto, like, clips and headbands and stuff. And he was like -- oh my god -- like me rocking my page -- whatever -- my stuff -- whatever. Anyways, so, like, me rocking pages the cute little tiny, tiny feather. Um, so I will make, um, another video when I actually have stuff up on my Etsy telling you guys to go check it out. But this is like a pre cursor kinda thing to what I do make.I sew so, um, I'm gonna have, like, bags and, like, whatever on there. I might make some, like, wallet type things like pouches and stuff. I got some vintage -- um -- zippers at a local thrift store. Like, I got a bunch of them so I don't know what I'm doing with them yet. I was thinking about making clothes because I do know how to sew and, like, I have sewn my own clothes before and stuff. But it's just so hard with, like, the sizes 'cause then it's, like, if I make it and it doesn't sell because it's not the right size and somebody's like oh you know that's like a size to small or a size to big on me and I'm just, like, well that sucks because it's one of a kind -- you know what I mean? So although I do alter my own clothes and stuff, um, I'm not gonna do it on there just because it's harder to do that.But, um, and I also wanna start doing an installation of at sea, like, sites. Like -- I know how Kaye does her, like, beauty hairs -- you should check out. Um -- that's Kaleen's Creation. I'll put her link in the sidebar too 'cause she's fabulous, um, even though most of you probably already know who she is. Um, but if you have an at sea site send me an email and I'll check it out, um, because I do want to start, like, send me a private message on here, um, I do want to start kind of showcasing it. Just to give you a hint though most of the at sea sites I will be promoting will be, like, really bright colorful vivid ones that are like, oh my gosh, you can tell we took time and effort to make our product. Not, like, here I put some beads on a string give me twenty dollars. Now like different if they're, like, real, like, legit stuff 'cause there are some stuff like that. But when you hint -- sometimes I've looked at at seas sites and, like, you some people messages and they're like hey check out my shop and I'm like oh you're stuff's sucks. But I don't say that because that would be rude. So, um, yeah, not that my stuff's, like, the most amazing stuff in the world but, yeah, I'm just kinda like okay can you like put a little effort into your products. Like -- at sea is supposed to be stuff made with love. Not just for, like, the money.So, yeah, I'm gonna do that and then I knit so I'll be having hats and wrist warmers and scarves and stuff. Um, not as many of those as, like, sewing stuff and, like, stuff I can glue and what not because that does take longer. I'm gonna be having wrist cuffs which are really awesome and their kind of like -- if you're like me you'll wear them on a daily basis but some people might just wear them if they're, like, going to, like, a costumey party or something. But if you're like me you'll just wear them because you're fabulous.Um, I have a lot of accessories like hair bows and like hair stuff , uh, like headbands and what not and clips. Um, I'm trying to think of what else. Bracelets, necklaces, earrings -- I have all the stuff to make it already. A lot of stuff with buttons -- oh, my god -- stuff with buttons I just love. Okay. That was really creepy sounding. Anyways, so I'll have, like, a lot of stuff like that. Um -- I'm trying to think of what else. 'cause I do like a lot of stuff with, like, charms and what not and, like, sewing and buttons and feathers and my stuff is very, very colorful -- the stuff I make. So if you're, like, into color you'll probably like it. Like, if you like spotted feathers on headbands and clips you'll probably like my site. So, um, yeah, that's it for the at sea stuff.I am gonna be making a lot more videos after Christmas. I don't know if said this or not already 'cause I've had to make this video, like, twelve times. My little sister keeps coming in here going Paigy, Paigy. And I'm like, okay Alex, I love you but I'm trying to make a video. Um -- but I asked for a camcorder for -- blah -- for Christmas preferably a flip cam. And so if I get that I'm gonna be making videos, like, nonstop but they won't be going out nonstop just because I don't wanna be annoying like you guys let me stand with a million videos. It'll kinda be like, I'll film a couple in a day and actually take time to edit them. Because I can't really edit on my webcam. Um -- but I do have an editing system it's just kinda, like, why bother with my webcam kinda thing, you know, So I will actually be taking time to edit them and we'll be having a contest where you'll win something that I made 'cause I'm gonna want a -- um -- like, an intro thingy but let's not talk about that right now. Hmm. I'll talk about that after this contest is over.So, yeah, my contest is gonna end January thirty first by the way. I'm gonna go back and edit that and now in like a little bubble, like, contest ends January thirty first. Hello! Um -- so you have until January thirty first, that's over a month and it's pretty simple contest. You can either do crazy or settle, like, school spirit. So go check it out.Um, I'm trying to think of what else. I know I had other stuff to say but I'm forgetting it so -- yeah, um, that's pretty much it. Request, request, request. Post like a million requests in here because I have a word document with stuff it's called YouTube Stuff saved on my computer. I just like requests because if I delete a video I always check the comments to make sure because I'll get random requests that are, like, Oh -- I know this has nothing to do with this video but could you do this?  And I'm like yes I will. So, um, the first video I kind 'a wanna make if I do get a flip cam -- of course I wanna do one with, like, hey guys here's what I got for Christmas. And then I wanna do a room tour because everybody does those room tours and I've gotten few requests to do them. I don't remember the names because it's been, like, too many people so I stopped counting. So it's like at least five people have asked me to do a room tour. So, um, I think that's it. Post requests and you can add my new MySpace that I made -- um -- because the other one was being weird. So, yeah, all the links are in the sidebar or down there if you're watching it on my main page. All right. Bye.","High","Low","High"

"VLOG197","British insurance company Willis Group holdings recently leased one hundred thousand square feet of my city's icon, the Sears tower. As part of this deal, the tower is being renamed, Willis Tower. The renaming of the Sears tower already has a lot of Chicagoans protesting saying, what you talking 'bout? No, really they are actually saying that; search YouTube. But here in Chicago we protest lots of important things.In the past, say eighteen eighty six, we protested thing like unfair labor practices in order to bring about progress. And as time went buy we started protesting things to preserve our history. Like when Chicagoans protested the renaming of a department store in two thousand and six and again in two thousand and seven and again in two thousand and eight. Speaking of history, historically some of our protests lead to the eight hour work day and the abolishment of child labor. No wonder there is so much unemployment; no kids working. Now all too often our protests seem to lead nowhere. History is important but without change it's not really history.And in this case I like to think of that historical quote. I think it was Shakespeare that said what's in a name, that which we call a rose by any other name is still a big ass building named after a corporation or something like that. Besides, it could have been worse. Hi I'm Martin Blow with Blow management. I'd like to buy some skyscrapers.","High","High","High"

"VLOG199","Hey guys. I know it's been a while. I've started uni and everything and a lot of stuff has been happening. I've been moving back to my house and everything; that's why I haven't made any videos and, yeah. I thought I'd do some videos today, as seeing I have time and everything, I'm off uni for a day and, um.Yeah, so I thought I'd do my September favorites, as you can probably tell from the title.Well before I start, I dyed my hair and got it cut. Um, I got it darker. It used to be really light, like reddish blond. Now it's more of a chocolaty blond, like a darker one if you can tell. It's completely different. Um, I'll do a before and after picture of what it was like and I'll probably be in my blog and I'll put the link in the side bar and yeah, so. The before picture's gonna be a picture from E, so if you want to see that as well, you guys can and yeah. So I thought I'd do my September favorites.And the first thing I want to pick are my two favorite brushes of the month, which were my all time favorite brushes. This one was like my -- before I started buying my own makeup, I started using this brush a lot. It was like, my only brush, which is the Cosmopolitan and blusher brush star 'cause I normally used sponges for my foundation and the sponges that you get with the eye shadows and that was like the only things I used to use and that was my only brush at that time.And, yeah, I really like this brush, because it's really affordable and it's like, five pounds or something in Superdrug and it's really soft for a drugstore brush. I haven't bought any like, any other drugstore brushes like, as far as I know, and I happen to be in Milly and number seven, I think, I'm not too sure, but this is a really good quality brush and it's really soft.And this brush here, the foundation brush, I use this as a 109 brush like the way I would use a one o nine brush, because it's very good at stippling in the foundation, blending it in. I really like this brush and it's not round, um, it's like tapered there and the reason why I like that is because if you want to do, um, your foundation like this, you can. You can use it all different ways and sometimes I use it for cream blush, to do it like that, do, um, a straight line lash and contouring as well, even though it's, um, like synthetic fibers, I still use it for contouring. So there are my two brushes. There.I have two mascaras from my favorite. First one is it's probably been in my favorites for the last couple of times and the reason why I just love this one is because of the, um, the brush, um, the formulation. And I use this only for my lower lash; I don't use it for my top lash. I love it for my lower lash and I'm wearing it today, if you can see. I'm using that today and I absolutely love this and mascara for that purpose and I don't use it for my top lash. The only reason because it gives you length, which I don't really look for in a mascara. I look for volume and thickness, so that's why I use this for my bottom lashes.And the second mascara is the Bourjois Coup de Theatre -- Coup de Theatre, two in one. Um, again, the formulation of, um, this mascara is brilliant. I love the brush, it's the plastic combed brushes there. And I just spent my because I think it's much easier to use as a -- um, to use -- it makes it easier because if you can see, it just gets in more better than a strip brush and the formulation is really good. It makes my lashes look thicker and it gives that wee bit of volume. I really find a good mascara that gives me the color, but it gives me volume and thickness, which is really good.And another thing is the matte luster drops. The reason why I love this it gives you that really nice bronzy glowy look which I love. I always mix it in with my foundation. Haven't really used it as a highlight, but for a foundation it's brilliant. It gives you this really nice shiny glowy effect if you're looking for that, that dewy look, which is supposed to be really in for Autumn as well, which is really good and, yeah, I really love it. And the one I have it in is in sunrush. I wish I got more of these actually because I only got one of them. Now I want more of them, so, yeah, really like that.Another Mark Daniel is my mineralized eye shadow, which is from their permanent line, I think it's the jewels and the one I like is play on plums which is this gorgeous plumy color at the top and this orange plumy color at the bottom, because it has that plum color at the end of the bottom, like all over here, and I'll do you a quick swatch. And there's the darker color here and the lighter color there. That's what I'm using on my eyes today if you're wondering.And, yeah, I used to put a black in the outer corners just to smoke it out a wee bit, but I really love it. It's great when you use it with fixed glass of water, but if you use it dry, you'll find a lot of fall out there's less fall out and the sha -- eye shadow's more intense.Um, yeah, nail polish of the month has to be my -- my -- um -- bright purple, which I've been using a lot this month. I'm not using it today, but I love it. It's just a gorgeous black purple color; it's great for summer -- it was great for the summer and now it's great for, um, the autumn as well. This purple is really in.And two lip products. First one is my Maybelline. Um, I don't know what type of lipstick. It's a Maybelline lipstick, I know that and the color is and it's this gorgeous brown, medium brown color. There; which is really lovely and for a nude color and there's this swatch; it's really moisturizer and it doesn't really dry my lips or anything. And the only downside is doesn't last long, but most of my lipsticks don't last long, but it's really moisturizing and I'd really recommend this lipstick.And second lipstick is from the number seventeen range from in the UK and this is one is the lasting fix lipstick in Hawaii pink. This is a really nice bright bubble gum pur -- pink color -- color and that's really nice to go with nude lips. Does it match my nail polish? It kind of matches my nail polish. I'm wearing pink flamingo if you're wondering and yeah, this is a really nice lipstick. It's not as moisturizing as the Maybelline one, but it's a great color payoff. There, if you can see, that's it there; it's a gorgeous color.Yeah, so, and last but not least my favorite eye liner of the month is My Gosh eyeliner in black ink. It's really creamy and it's not that hard. Like I heard most of My Gosh eyeliners have been disappointing for some people, because it's been hard and everything. Um, I have this and I have alligator which is the green one and both of them have worked perfectly fine for me and they're really nice and creamy and they haven't dried me out or anything, so, and they stay on my eyes for a long time because I think they're waterproof. Yeah, they're waterproof which is really good as well.So, um, that's my favorite, guys and I hope you enjoyed.

"VLOG202","﻿Okay, take two. Um, did you ever have one of those days where you just felt like an alien from another planet? I mean, everywhere you go, it's like weird?Like you go in the grocery store and you're like, you know, somebody says um, did you find everything you need and I'm like, well um, I could use a million dollars. And it's like it's just, hm, like they don't even respond. I mean, that's kinda lame but, you know, they could say something.I mean, every person I encountered today was just so not funny, at all. It was bizarre. I was like, I don't know, it's the kinda day that you -- you walk away and like not one single person smiles at you or laughs at anything you say and they just look at you like you're crazy and you go home and you like, start thinking that you're a loser, because like, you talk too much and you say stupid stuff and like you just open your mouth to change feet and you just feel like a total loser because you're not funny. You're not funny at all. And you're so not funny that you begin to really like, freak out and think, what's wrong with me?And then like you get on your iPod and you start listening to all this depressing music and like, you're so into that like depressing mood, you know?It's like Emo and you're listening to this stuff and you're just like oh my God, I'm such a loser. I am such a loser. I want to jump off a cliff.And then like, all of a sudden your iPod shuffles and it's like, Amazing Grace or something that you put on there like ten years ago when you like, never had an iPod before. But -- I mean it's like all a sudden then you're like, oh Jesus I love you, thank you so much for I'm so glad I'm alive.And then all of a sudden like that other stuff starts splaying again, and then all of a sudden you're like, jamming to Boston and it's like, you're thinking about the old days and then you start to think, oh my God, I'm old. I remember when Boston, More Than a Feeling came out.And then like, that makes you feel worse because not only now are you not funny and you talk too much, now you're old too.Wow, okay, that's like so depressing.","Low","Low","High"

"VLOG205","﻿Hi, everyone. Uh, yeah, I know it's been at least two and a half weeks, maybe three weeks, since I've made a video. Um, I want to make this video, uh, for -- it should help out some of my, um, fellow Feministas, especially, uh, feminists in Canada. Um, I've noticed that, um, when you, uh, speak out very loudly against the patriarchy, um -- whether you're talking about, uh, pornography or domestic violence or the Men's Rights Movement, or the TFL Movement, any -- any of that stuff, when you go up against it, you will sometimes encounter a massive amount of resistance. And that's simple backlash misogyny that most feminists are aware of.But, the main reason I want to make this video is because in Canada, you -- you can do something about this. If, um, someone is harassing you, uh, or posting personal information about you, um, threatening you, intimidating you, that is a violation of the Criminal Code of Canada. And I will tell you the steps of what you need to do to, uh, open a file and make sure that, you know, you have a case and you're -- it's open and you're protected.The first thing that you need to do is, wherever you live, uh, call the RCMP, or, um, you know, if you're in a city, if you have a city police force you can call them. But, uh, all of the, uh, police forces have, um, an internet, uh, crime division. And, um -- so basically what'll happen is you'll call them, you'll let them know what's happening, and, uh, the constables will come to, uh, where you live and they will, uh, look over, uh, the data. Uh, they will open a file and, um, you will then email them, uh, a lot of stuff. If the threat is, um, particularly, um, bad, uh, you know, they'll -- they'll get to work on it right away. But usually, um, after they come to your place, they will go back to, uh, the office and they will, um, work -- start work on your case right away.So, the most important thing that you need to do is you need to document things. And, uh, your constable will, um, uh, give you an email address and, um, phone numbers and things like that, so that if anything escalates, uh, you can just continue to send all the data. Now, when they go back to the office, um, basically, they find out who it is. So, they monitor who these people are, and um -- so there is recourse. Um, you know, I -- I know what's happening to, um, Antique Lens. It happened to me. And so, you know, um, I think in all the years of me being on the internet, I've, um, opened two case files against two people. And, um, one of them is still open. Uh, the other one is closed for now, but can be opened at any time. Uh, so, um, yeah, I mean, you're -- if YouTube isn't going to do anything about it, they don't -- you don't need YouTube's cooperation. The RCMP will handle this. And -- and it is a violation of the Criminal Code, and you can look it up online. It's there. I can't remember what section it is, but, um, it is there. So, this is just to help my, um -- um, my fellow feministos in Canada. Um, if you have any other questions that you want to ask me about the procedure or the process, just drop me a private message and, um, I'll answer as fast as I can with what I know.So that's it for now. It's really good to see everybody coming on the, uh -- on the Feminist two group. Uh, that's really, really good, so I'm -- I'm happy that it's growing. Um, I've just been really busy. Um, I got a promotion and I'm moving to Whistler, so, um, yeah, that's -- and of course, near the holidays I'm extremely busy with my job. So, anyway, it's good to, uh, say, hi, to everyone out there again. And, uh -- oh, maybe I'll do my -- my queenly wave. You know, she does that little -- that little wave. Ha. Anyway, um, peace out, blessed be, and ciao 'til next time.","High","High","High"

So there a few things I want to talk about with you guys today. First thing, save Jesus from the dragons . Do it now.Okay, second thing, it was recently brought to me by this black guy that . So it was recently brought to me by a buddy of mine Lamar that as of late my videos have been slightly different. And to be honest, I agree with him. This is not necessarily a negative thing. But I have seen a change over the last few months. In my opinion, my videos have become a tad bit too repetitive and a little bit dull at times. I mean you guys still seem to like them. But who cares, you guys are douche bags. I'm kidding guys. Wow, I'm kidding. I'm sorry. All I'm saying guys, is that I kind of want to go back to the way it used to be before, when I enjoyed the finer things in life, like going down to the beach on Sundays and slapping chimpanzees. You know, good times. So yeah, now I'm just going to try do something different in my videos. Look at last month when I moved away from your mom to your dad, huh. What's moving on?Third thing. In my last video I mentioned that I was going to be getting a Mac Pro in a week and it was just like care bears, fun. That obviously didn't happen yet. Mostly because my Mac decided to take a dump on my face, two girls went top style. Gross, yeah. Basically my being cancelled and my Mac won't be arriving until the sixth of August.Which brings us to our fourth point. Currently today until the date of fourteenth of August, which means no Mac until the fourteenth. However, fear not I'll still try make videos whilst I'm here so, awesome.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG212","And now I am back home. And as you can tell, I went to go see Toy Story One and Two in three D. These are my three D specs. Do you like 'em? I like 'em. Do you like 'em? I don't care if you like 'em 'cause I like 'em. I had a good day; it was good. It was hot. Go see Toy Story One and Two in three D. It's awesome, totally worth it. It's really good. Hope you guys have a great day or did have a great day. Ta ta till tomorrow.Well, hey there, everyone. It is a beautiful day in Richmond, Virginia. And for the beginning of October, I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be eighty five degrees. But the upside to it is, I got Subways so I'm going to eat, have a good meal, let this bus pass 'cause it's really loud. But going into the Comic Bookstore. Go on into the Comic Bookstore. It's going to be good times. I'm excited to read my comics and this is Broad Street, loud as hell. Yeah. Broad Street. Thanks for being loud and not letting me blog. Douche bags.Here I am at the CT, which is basically the Virginia Commonwealth University newspaper. Where, apparently, me being a blogger, is enough to get me a piece for the website, or something like that? I don't know. I got a call from that chick right there, and she was like, Sid, you know, we need a blogger to talk about information about the Internet.  And I said, Yeah, I would love to, 'cause I'm an Internet sensation.  And, uh, I -- I agreed to it. So, I'll let you guys know where to go. It's probably going to be ct. com or something? What is it? CT? commonwealthtimes. com, so go there. Probably starting next week I'm going to be doing blogs for these people. I'm excited, so, yay!","High","High","Low"
"VLOG213","Zero rushing touch downs this entire season so far. Zero rushing touchdowns. Zero point zero. Pretty simple but interesting question was asked to both Terrell Owens and to Trent Edwards.The question was, if you were a fan today in the stands, would you too have been booing the team? Terrell Owens' response: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I would. They deserve better. And I agree with him there. Um, I wasn't in the stands yesterday, but I was a fan booing.When asked the same question in the post game press conference to Trent Edwards. Here's his answer: I'm not a Bills fan; I'm a football player here, so I can't really answer that question. Well, well, fans out there, I think we just found part of the problem.Our quarterback's not a fan of the team, apparently not on any level, because if he was, on any level, he would have answered like Terrell Owens, who said, you know what? Yeah, I would have booed because that was just a total disgrace, the sloppiest, crappiest football I've ever seen. But no; his answer: I'm, I'm not a fan, I'm a player here. Maybe that's why, you know, there's a little bit of lack of passion, you know?Um, let's talk about the penalties. Thirteen accepted penalties. There was actually much more called. I'm pretty sure they got to like sixteen, maybe seventeen penalties called. Thirteen penalties accepted, and of those thirteen, nine of them were false starts. What? Nine false starts.Roscoe Parrish's fumble. Sort of remind you of anything? Maybe uh, game one of the season, Monday night against the Patriots? Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Don't tou -- what? He touched it. Oh my God, the Browns got the ball. Lee Evans, in a post game interview, said to a reporter in the locker room, quote: I can't stand it. I can't stand to see it get much worse.Well, uh, nice statement, Lee, 'cause neither can any of us fans. Would -- I can't possibly think that this could get much worse, but guess what? We have to go to the Meadowlands next week and play the Jets. Okay. Dick Jauron has lost every single divisional game for the Bills since December ninth of two thousand and seven, and the Bills are zero and eight since then, losing every single AFC East game they've played last year and two of them this year.Since Dick Jauron signed his contract extension, Dick Jauron with the Bills is three in twelve since that contract extension and one in seven at home. I have a hard time believing that anyone on this team is still fully behind Dick Jauron.And you know, if the players aren't behind the coach, you end up with a game like this past Sunday.","High","Low","High"

"VLOG216","Okay, so, Sunday I took the kids the kids to the mall because it was raining. We couldn't skate. Just -- just don't ask questions, okay? That's what we did. We went to the mall. Bad idea. It's way too close to Christmas. Very packed, not fun. Don't do it. Anyways, um, so we went into the skate shop/surf shop/we sell girls' underwear kind of place. Um -- I live four hours away from the ocean. So for anybody to actually surf around here is kind of uncommon. I don't know why there is a surf shop here. I mean -- I assume they have them at the beach as well. So why not just wait till you got the beach to buy your -- but anyways, anyways - surf shop in the mall. Oh! That makes a whole lot of sense. Um -- shit, that pisses me off. So anyways, what we do is we always go in there and we -- we raise a little alley. You know, we try on the wet suits -- which by the way smell like frog. I don't know if you guys knew that. Wet suits smell like frog. But that might just be because I've been in every single, uh, wet suit in there and, uh, sweat in them. Which makes them sweat suits. Just kidding. Um -- they smell like frogs though, seriously. Um -- and like stick up little -- little local skate shop stickers. And -- it -- it -- it's good times, okay. We -- we -- best thing to do, okay, when we go in there, ask them questions about their skateboards. It's hilarious. Okay. So I go back there and I -- I've been doing a little bit of research on these new gimmick skateboard -- skateboards, like -- like the Almost Impact and the -- and the Pearlite and obviously the P two. Um, so I see the Pearlite on the wall and I'm like okay, this is gonna be fun. I walked into the guy. I'm like, Hey, what can you tell me about that uh -- that Plan B Pearlite over there?  He gets it out and he's like Um -- Reads the packaging. It's -- its' lighter, thinner, stronger. Yeah, that's what the packaging says. That's exactly what it is. I hear great things about these all the time. They're just -- they're awesome. You should probably buy one like right now.  And I'm like, Good God dude and I'm freaking. I went into this whole spiel. I'm pretty sure I quoted the entire website on his ass. Awesome. Awesome.And then this kid walks up. I wish he had done that when I was owning the dude. And he's like, Hey I want that baker board over there and I want it gripped with Jessup.  Jessup makes you mess up. Okay. Dawn, that's for you. That was a little weird. I'm not gonna laugh. Anyways, so the guy -- the guy's trying to grip this board, right? And -- and he's trying to train this other dude too because -- well, I don't really know. It was kind a like the blind leading the blind. But anyways, he just kind 'a throws the grip tape at it and it sticks. And it's -- its like -- I don't know how it stuck and had that many bubbles in it. It was absolutely insane. I don't understand how that even happened. It looked like a hot dog with -- with -- you know -- the baker logo on the bottom down here and the grip tape on the top. It was ridiculous. I don't know how he got that many air bubbles in it. He didn't sand down the edges, he just sat there and he poked out all the air bubbles with pins and then flattened out the grip tape. I was like you idiot I wanna slap you on the freaking mouth right now. I have literally not wanted to grip a board so bad in my entire life. Like I just wanted to push him out of the way. Like flip him over the glass counter and do it myself. Pisses me off. It was so bad. And then, he doesn't -- he doesn't file down the edges or anything like that that you would normally do when you're gripping a skateboard. No. No. He just throws the grip tape on there and starts trying to cut it out and can't figure out why it's all freaking wavy and crap and it doesn't look anything like it should look. It was awful. It looked disgusting. I wanted to punch him in the mouth. Anyways, that's one story.Another story -- shit -- I forgot which one I was gonna tell you guys. Ah -- what did we do? Oh -- yeah -- um, so local skate shop again was having this -- this contest for t shirt designs and skateboard designs. And Deshawn had drawn up a bunch of designs. And, uh, he didn't realize that because he wasn't eighteen yet he couldn't enter the contest without his parent's signature. And I wasn't about to drive a half hour to go home to get his mom to sign a sheet of paper and then drive back. So the guys at the skate shop were like, Hey, if you just go out to the car and sign this yourself, we'll never know.  And I'm like well -- that's a lot less fun. So what we're gonna do is, we're going to the mall and we'll talk to you guys in a little bit. So we were walking in the mall and we were looking for a girl. Any girl would've done really. But we got all the way to this Malinick's place before we found anybody. And we got in there and there's these two cute little blond girls sitting at the counter. Not doing anything because that place doesn't sell shit because they fucking bick . But anyways. So we get up there and Deshawn is like Hey, I need you guys to sign this so that I could get in this contest -- right?  And they were like, Oh cool. We could do that. Yeah, we could pretend to be your mom. What's your name?  He tells her his name and shit like that. And they're -- they're taking turns writing on this sheet of paper -- not the actual form -- but just random pieces of paper, to see who has the better signature. And they finally decided who has the better signature and they sign it and they're like, Oh, cool. I hope you win that contest. Don't break your arm or anything. I'm like You fucking idiots. It says right on it that it's an art competition. He's drawing something. Is he really gonna break his arm drawing something?  They thought this was a legitimate skate contest and that 200 pound Deshawn was gonna be in it and -- and win the shit. What? Use your brain people.Anyways, I'm gonna go now. I have a lot more to say because I'm a little bit hyper. But I -- I'm gonna leave at that. Um -- do you guys -- do you guys do this too or is it just me? Am I the only person in the world that does this? Because I think it's freaking great.","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG217","Hey, guys. So, like ten in the morning and I've been up like all night. I woke up yesterday at like, oh, about two thirty in the afternoon yesterday. Then I went back to sleep because I was really tired. Then I slept 'til like six. So I've been up since then. It's like, yeah. I'm getting pretty tired.I really want to go to sleep but, you know, I'll just end up sleeping all day and then I'll be up all night again -- starts that cycle, you know? This is what happens when you go out drinking and then you have a really bad hangover the next day which makes you sleep all day. So, I think the lesson here is, don't go out and drink and get a hangover the next day, you know? Avoid the hangover. Maybe drink some V eight, I don't know. I mean, I usually don't get really get bad hangovers but for some reason -Anyways, not much is new here. Still unemployed, you know, living the good life of being a bum and partying non stop while being a broke ass, then sleeping all day. Yep. So, um, I did have a job interview on Saturday. It went really well until they gave me a drug test. Yeah. Never had to do a drug test for a job before. It was just like that swab test where you keep that thing in your mouth for like a minute or so. So everything went great on the interview and then it was like, okay, we'll just give you a drug test. And I was, like, okay. You know, I can -- all like, everything's cool. I'm not a druggie -- which I'm not. I don't really do drugs anymore and I don't even smoke weed anymore. I quit. Up until like, last week, like I was totally clean, right? I haven't done anything in so long and I didn't even smoke. I don't smoke anymore. I smoke on -- or I smoked on New Year's Eve, like a little bit, and I didn't even like it, really. You know? I don't like that feeling.So, um -- yeah. Then last week, I, uh, was just at this party and my friend was like, oh, I'll buy you some pills and I was like, well, I haven't done it in so long, like a year and a half probably or more. So I was like, why not? If you're gonna buy it for me, why not? So, yeah -- and that was like a week ago, or last Friday, so like more than a week ago.And apparently, like, I looked up those -- those drug tests online -- the saliva ones? They can only tell the drugs that have been in your system for, like, three days or something -- three or four days. So it was a good, like, seven to eight days so maybe it will come out good. I mean, I really hope so, because I'm getting really sick of this whole being a bum thing.I mean, my car insurance expires today so no more driving for me unless I want to risk getting pulled over and getting a ticket for no car insurance and then I have to pay, like, so much money if I got a ticket which is totally not even worth it.So this just sucks, you know? But I should be finding out about that job, like -- what's to day? Tuesday? Tomorrow or Thursday. So I'm really hoping for that, you know? It was kind of a lame job. I would be a bagger at Safeway which is a grocery store . I'd be one of those baggers. Bag your food for you? Asking old ladies if they need help out to their car. I'd be that sad, miserable person pushing the carts around in the snow out of the parking lot. But hey, it's a job.Oh, right. Um, so this morning, I was sleeping, right? And don't ya freaking hate it when people call you when you're sleeping? Yeah, I do. So my friend calls me and I'm all sleeping, you know. I was so tired. So I grab my phone to hit Ignore and -- I don't know if you can see over there. There's like a coffee cup right over there on my nightstand. There's my bed. I'm sleeping there, you know? Yeah? And, uh, I hit Ignore and then put it on my nightstand -- goes right into the coffee cup. Yeah. I hear this, like, dunk and splash or whatever. So I'm like, oh, crap. So I reach in the coffee cup, and I pull it out, and I just like shook it off and then threw it on the floor. I didn't wake up to see like if it was all right, if it was broken, you know. I didn't give a shit. I just wanted to sleep.But it's all good, see? It's a little sticky. I didn't wash it off yet but it's good, no damage done. Score. Shit, I just called someone. Sorry.Anyways, I think that does it for my video. Once I find something interesting to talk about, maybe I'll make another one. All right.","Low","High","Low"
"VLOG218","﻿So, even though my dear friend could not be here with us right now, I will show you a photo of the stocking that she -- she did make. That should be going up some where in front of my face, now. Yeah, soak it in, that's right, boom, not just any stalking, a uh, a uh tube sock stocking. Go XXXX. And of course, you know, I had to make something bizarre and seemingly clever, in my own opinion, and so I made, oh goodness, I made a, um, stocking for an octopus. There you go. It is an eight legged stocking for an octopus because I think -- you know they want to celebrate under the sea, right? But don't fret kiddies, it does have an actual like stocking hole so it's a fully functional, uh, stocking for octopi. I think that's, yes -- that's plural for octopus, right?I'm going to talk a little bit quieter now. As far as what I want for Christmas, honestly, it sounds so sappy and it sounds so like rehearsed but I don't know, there is nothing that I really want. I mean you can ask my parents. I haven't asked for anything for Christmas because, aw, it sounds lame but the things I want for Christmas you can't like put a price on. Like I just want to be in good health. I want my friends to be happy, all of my family to be safe. I want to be successful at what I do. I want to come up with cool ideas and -- I don't know, those are what I want right now. As far as material go I -- I don't know, I'm pretty blessed and I have -- like I have what I want. I can't really think of anything else like a possession or something that I need. I just -- I mean of course I would love more books. I would love more movies and music and things like that, but nothing that I want badly enough to just like, put on list, and ask somebody to buy it for me. So I don't know, I don't really have a -- a Christmas list. I literally have not made one and I haven't asked for anything because, uh, anyways at random, and like don't let me guilt you into thinking that you're -- you're not supposed to want a Christmas list. It's totally cool if you want stuff for Christmas. If you want all of that cool stuff, by all means, write your little heart out to Santa until you -- your little heart can't write no more. I don't know if you can tell, but I'm tired. So, I am going to end this video. It is-- well Apple says it is one ten in the morning, so I am going to edit this and get some sleep. By sleep I mean watch some more Supernatural on DVD until it is a stupid hour in the morning, and then wish that I didn't stay up that long. Happy Holidays.﻿So first and foremost, XXXX couldn't be part of the vlog portion this time around because my camera actually died while we were at her house. She did, however, give me a list of things she wanted for Christmas, but I suck and I don't think I took the list with me, so I'm gonna try to remember what was on it.She wanted rocket powered something. Yeah, some kind of appliance that's like powered by rockets. Confusingly enough, I also think she wanted the first season of Rocket Power on DVD. She could have put Boy Meets World on DVD, maybe? Sere -- I am such a bad friend.Me and XXXX are just artistic masochists, who decided to keep drawing, even though it's not part of the challenge. Bottom line is, after we were done with our stockings, we continued drawing and we both did, uh, Santa Claus. Now, the first Santa Claus I'm gonna show you is the one XXXX made. Whoa bang. So this is XXXX's sexy Santa. He's got liver spots, a not so happy trail, fishnets, a cookie hand, cool nips, stretch marks, a cookie gut -- oh and a happy in cookie hand. I took a different route and I am not a lover like sexy Santa, I am a fighter. So I made brutal Santa.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG219","Hi, everybody. So, XXXX tagged me in this YouTube game.

Here's the photographic evidence. That's me, baby Katie with my Dad, and a sled dog. Oop, there we go, there, much better, okay? And my Dad raised me and he didn't have a choice. And when I was five we moved away.Uh, here's another fact. I am fascinated by the history of the American West. Um, the frontier town, the gold rushes, the Oregon Trail, outlaws, our clashes between the Native Americans, all of it. I love it. Um, and I haven't done much to pursue that interest, other than watch movies, read books, and become a dedicated fan of Deadwood, may it rest in peace.Here's another fact. I am the oldest of three children, and my little sister is fourteen years younger than me, and she's awesome.Alright, final fact. I have huge literary crushes on Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor and James Tiptree, Jr. , aka Alice Sheldon. I just love great story telling and really freaky dark stuff, and those ladies do it for me.So now that I'm no longer it, I'm going to choose five YouTubers to um, answer, to be it now.

Results too -- that I've been putting off for a long time, not because I'm busy because I'm totally like dilly dallying or something.The Disney Fact contest. Um, I got tons of interviews, it was a huge shock because normally, things like that, I'm, like, maybe two entries, and now I got like maybe ten, which is a lot, I think. Um, so thank you to everybody who entered. Um, you had a lot of really cool facts, more than I knew um, which is like cool to you know, you know think that actually found those facts out -- wow, I'm a cheesy -- I'm a cheesy? What? I don't know, what? I don't know, that really didn't come out right.And some of them, I didn't know, but I was impressed with one in particular that I spent, like, hours searching to confirm it because I thought it was so crazy and so cool. I've was actually stuck between three winners, um but I had to go with this one.So anyway, without and further ado, I really want to be dramatic and it put this thing in, like, an envelope. In like, in like, a thick envelope. And the winner of the Disney Fact contest is -- thank you, Nader ! Congratulations Nathan , um. His fact was pretty freaking awesome.Okay, so check this out. For those of you that haven't been to Disneyland or Disney World, and haven't ridden on a lot of adventure rides. In the ride, there is a glass window that goes wall to wall, floor to ceiling. So, this wise guy decided to bring in a BB gun on the ride. He shot through the glass window and left a whole in it. Because of the size of the glass, and because of the price that it would cost them to replace it, they just decided to go the easy way out and cover it up with a spider. I thought that was pretty crazy, um, this is Jenader .Send me your mailing address to my e mail at yahoo. com and I will send you your prize.All right guys have a nice day, and, uh, later skaters.

"VLOG222","Hello. So guys, this is my hundred fifty first ever blog. The reason I'm telling you about my hundred fifty first blog is because I forgot that my last one was my hundred fiftieth. Somehow a hundred fifty seems like a more rounded, suitable number for a milestone than a hundred fifty one, but you're just going to have to deal with it 'cause, I forgot.So, yeah, hundred fifty first video, wanted to do something cool to celebrate, couldn't think of anything cool to do to celebrate. So what I'm going to do, I know a lot of people make awesome cakes and stuff; I'm just going to tell you a joke.It's my favorite joke in the whole world. Okay, here's my joke, I've actually said this joke in a blog before but I'm hoping that none of you remember, because if you do remember, I'm gonna feel kind of stupid for recycling my joke.Anyway, this is my absolute specialty of a joke, it is my uber cool, amazing, awesome, perfect joke that I'm building up really badly, and you're probably gonna be really disappointed. Two muffins are in an oven, one muffin says, Cor, it's a bit hot in here,  and the other muffin says, Aah, a talking muffin. Isn't that joke just amazing though? Because I think I first heard that joke when I was like, ten, and I remember thinking when I was ten, that is, you know, that is one hell of a joke, but in the last two days I have come across three people who don't understand that joke.Now, it's all fine when someone doesn't understand a joke, but when they analyze the joke, and pick apart the joke, and are like, this joke doesn't make sense, because this is this -- that really bugs me. It's like, you don't get it, just shut up about it.Not that I'm pointing fingers at anyone, Tom, seeing as you wanted a shout out. Here's your shout out, you ruined my joke, why'd you ruin my joke? I'm only joking, it was fine that you ruined my joke, I won't hold it against you.Can everyone, please, leave their favorite jokes in the comments? 'Cause, it will just be fun for me to read, and if there's any really good ones, I'll read them out in my next video.Anyway, what have I been doing lately? I've been watching X Factor lately which I don't even want to talk about because I'm just still too angry about it.And on Saturday I went on a school trip to see plays about sex trafficking, which was very, very, depressing because you kinda think that that sort of thing only happens in third world countries and really, like, undeveloped places, but there's fifty illegal sex trade places in Croydon alone, which in context is like, a small part of London. That was really, really, really hard hitting, and it made me think that we suck as a country.I'm gonna just say one more thing, because this is, like, really important. So, I -- I'm sure most of you know what Chartjackers is by now, but if you don't, basically, four UK bloggers. Alex, Charlie, Jimmy and Johnny were picked by the BBC and asked if they would write and produce and perform, using the YouTube community -- I'm just using my head instead of my hands, 'cause I'm holding my laptop on my knees.Um, the song that they were gonna release in the charts for Children in Need, which was done. And now all that needs to happen, is that everyone needs to buy the song so that we can raise loads, and loads, and loads and loads of money for Children in Need.So I'm going to put a link in the sidebar to the song which you can buy from iTunes and Children in Need own the song now, so every single penny goes to them. So it will be so good if you could buy the song, even if you hate the song, but you won't hate the song 'cause it's an amazing song.So yeah, I'm going to go now and I'm going to leave you with this thought. It's my eighteenth birthday on Thursday, the nineteenth November.Goodbye.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG223","Hey everyone, it's XXXX and it's been a while since I've put anything on my personal channel, but I thought this would be a good mix with the type of video -- the caliber, if you will, of videos that I posted on my personal channel, um, whether I'm stuck in a box, or, uh, you know, a spider down below. Uh, I think that this might -- might fit well.Uh, I had mentioned that I learned via Darrings Dance Grooves. I don't know if any of you used it back in like eighth grade or something, or maybe you young's are too young for it. But um, Darrings Dance Grooves helped me learn a chorus of Britney Spears' You Drive Me Crazy, so I danced it up for you guys. I just did it, so it's a little bit backwards. But, um, I learned it and I did it and it's there. So, uh, don't judge me too harshly. I have no dance background. I just -- I just like to dance. Just got to dance. Screw girls tonight. I just want to dance.You can not do/You drive me crazy/I just can't sleep/I'm so excited I'm in too deep/Ohh, crazy, but it feels all right/Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night. I just wanted to say hey and um, I know that I've had a bunch more new -- new viewers so thank you so much. I'm glad that you think I'm interesting. I guess that is kind of validating for the -- for the things that I do in my life so I hope that you stick around, that you comment and send video responses.If you have learned anything on Darrings Dance Grooves, 'fess up. Whether it's via video or comments, I want to hear about it.Um, I am like always on here doing the weirdest things. I'm so sorry, I feel like I , huh, it's-- it's three in the morning you guys, this is like the afternoon for me. I -- I -- all my friends get tired and then I am still up so I do this. This is my life. I am a vampire.I know that you lesbians are really into vampires. I don't know why. Well actually I do because I think it's pretty hot too. But, um, but I am a vampire. I stay up late at night. I rarely see the sun as you can tell by my pale complexion. I just -- I just want to talk to someone.I wish that other people were awake at 3 am and would like do this stupid shit with me 'cause it's not really fun when I'm doing it alone and talking to my computer. You know, when -- when you watch it, it doesn't seem so weird because you're like watching it but when I'm doing it alone in my house at three A. M. , little creepy.So this is my life. I'm living it.Okay. Byyyyyyyyyye.","High","High","High"
"VLOG224","And don't you think it's really annoying when people apologize, like, over apologize, about not making a video? I'm really the victim, like the viewers. But I -- I -- I always feel like I want to apologize when I don't make a video for a very long time. It's, like, I did vanish, but not really.So, I've been doing nothing, in a really good way, I guess. Yeah, in a -- in a really good way, do nothing in a really good, fun -- just making making a video too. Bet you want to see my face, even though my hair covers it anyway. Um, but I've also been wondering what makes somebody shallow? Like, not limited to, like, physical parents, but when you find out someone you're interested in and, like, really into music that you don't like, or an artist you absolutely hate, and that's such a turn off that you're not attracted to that person any more. Is that -- is that considered shallow or something -- something like that? If -- if you like, uh, very, um, deep things, so I guess it is, but I don't know -- what are your thoughts? Please tell me. I can't trick my own thoughts.Oh, I got a little bit tanner. Not too much tanner, but a little -- little bit tanner, so it doesn't look like I'm Boo Radley, uh, To Kill A Mockingbird. Sometimes I just like making faces. Like now.Hi. I'm just waiting for my camera to change colors. Okay, I think that's it.So it's been a really long time. Um, I don't really have an excuse, but I'm just in a frump, really. You can understand that.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG225","﻿Today is going to be a very different video than any video that I've done before. It's because today, I'm going to be asking you for help. Now during the summer of 2009, the group XXXX got together and we decided that it would be really, really good for us and good for the community if we got together and did a charity event.Now we went through a lot of charity ideas, lot of different organizations, great organizations, but the one that we actually came up with in the end to raise funds for was the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We came up with that one specifically for two reasons.Number one, they are at the forefront of science research to eliminate cancer from our society. The second reason was their direct involvement with children. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital works directly with children and never turns a child away because of their inability to pay the bill.So, many cases, all over the United States, children who are sick and stricken down with cancer and really need some serious help, but they don't have the ability to pay, can go there and get world class treatment without the worrying of being able to pay for some of the experimental treatments or some of the great care that they get at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.Now, we batted around a lot of ideas also as far as what to actually do, what kind of charity to do. Now a few months ago, a lot of you remember that DPR did a great charity event, a twenty four hour marathon to raise money for Doctors Without Borders. Now we had thought about that honestly, um, as a way to raise money, but that was kind of the idea that cemented it. So what we're going to do is this. We're going to take the basic premise of a charity marathon on blog TV and we're going to up the ante a little bit. We are going to up the ante in several ways.First off, we are going to be asking for donations. We have a page set up and a link to that page will be in the side bar. This is a page set up directly through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, so as soon as you make a contribution, one hundred percent of that money will go directly to them and go right to work helping cancer research and helping children who need it.The second thing that we're going to be doing is the eBay channel. Now that is an idea that we did directly steal from DPR and sorry for that. Um, I spoke with him and he said it's for a great charity then go for it. We're going to be donating items directly for that and we're also going to be asking for items that you would like to donate to go on to the eBay channel and one hundred percent of the money that we get from that, will go directly also to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.Now the final way that we're going to collect money is this. When you were in school, a lot of you remember doing rockathons or walkathons or mathathons. That's similar to what we're going to do for our final stage. What it comes down to is this. On the eighteenth of December, that's a Friday morning, I'm gonna to wake up and I'm gonna to sit down in front of the camera.The charity event itself has no time limit whatsoever. I will continue to talk, I will continue to bring on co hosts, I will read papers, I will read articles, I'll discuss issues. Anything that I can do to stay awake and to keep going. We're asking people to pledge money, X amount of dollars or X amount of cents for every hour that I stay on and then at the end when I actually finish, when my head literally hits the keyboard, that's going to be the stop time. Then we'll multiply however much you pledged times how many hours we lasted and that will be your donation amount.Um, I understand that this is going to happen on December eighteenth. That's another hiccup that we've come up with, um, throughout many hiccups actually, so I understand the time frame of Christmas being right there. That's why we're not going to ask for the donations until the thirtieth of January.At the -- on the thirtieth of January, that's when we will ask for all the donations to be in, so we'll do a final check cut and send that directly to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and we'll also be clearing out the bank account showing that on camera also as a little field trip exercise, to actually head to Memphis and to uh, give it to them personally, to make sure that they get every penny that you donate.Now, what we're doing now is, uh, we've reserved a hotel room to start us off in, so we're going to be broadcasting this from somewhere, not here, where we can actually have people. We're going to be doing a cooking show. We've got a bunch of things planned that go beyond just me sitting in front of a camera. Uh, so I'll be showing you my famous spinach lasagna. Um, we'll be cooking that. We'll also have a grab bag, but more details about all of that stuff will come in the following weeks.I'm going to try to plan to do one video every week showing you the progress and whose, uh, whose in for co hosting and little things that we have planned.So, for now, what I wanted to leave you with is the general idea of what we're planning to do. We're also going to be asking for co hosts, anybody who wants to come on. If you find a great news article, if you have something that you just really want to discuss and get opinions on, feel free to send us a PM or send an email. I'm going to put the email right here, right about now, so that you can see it. So it will be occamsrazorsua at yahoo dot com. We're looking forward to getting your ideas, we want to know what you think about it. We would love to have, um, as many articles, as many things, as many topics, as many issues as we can raise in this time frame.Now I'm going to say again, this has no time limit whatsoever. We start on Friday morning. When we end simply depends on when I can't talk anymore or when I can't blog anymore or when I can't continue.So, like I said before, we'll be doing more videos to update you as we get more information and thank you for watching this and stay tuned for this little quick snippet.Oh, I won't back down, no, I won't back down. You can stand me up at the gates of Hell, but I won't back down. No, I won't back down, my feet turned around, in a world that keeps on pushing me around, I'm gonna stand my ground. And I won't back down. I won't back down, baby. There ain't no easy way out, but I, I will stand my ground and I won't back down. 'Cause I know. . .So what we're asking for now is for people to give us a hand, to volunteer to co host, to moderate the chat, to donate money, to donate items, to pledge money, to mirror this video. Basically, we're asking for anyone who can give us a hand with making this a really good charity to please do so.So, my only question to you is, who's in?Oh, baby, there ain't no easy way out.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG226","﻿Alright. Today, we've come together on a very rainy day. It's not just a rainy day, it's raining carrots today. On this very rainy day, it's raining carrots, everywhere in the entire world. People, come together and celebrate the rainy day or carrots. And not only are they happy, they also are a little bit sad because some people don't like carrots. And when it rains carrots, people who don't like carrots are not very happy with it.So, most of the people like this day, but a lot of you don't. And, I know it's sad, but you have to make the best out of it. I mean, it's raining carrots and you can't help it so, you should just adjust yourself and start liking carrots because it will be rainy day carrots for a long time. With that I mean, it will be raining carrots for a lot of time. And I have some tips for you if you don't like carrots. Because if you don't like them, you are not happy, as I've said before. Which is kind of illogical, but hey, some people don't know it.So my first step is, just stand on a bridge where it does not rain carrots. You should kneel down and say, I like to eat sandwiches with toothpaste on it. From that very moment from when you said that word, that sentence, you will not like carrots, because it makes no sense. However, if -- just start eating carrots against your own will, you might find yourself happy one day, and you look back and you say, hmm, that time when it rained carrots, oh that was a good time.You know why it's raining carrots, right? You don't. All right. I was trying to briefly explain why it's raining carrots, but if you don't understand it, then it's not my fault. I mean, I'm not the one who made it up right? Right? Right? Anyways, let's continue. It's raining carrots for just one obvious reason. That obvious reason is, because it's hot in Australia. In Australia the kangaroos hop around with high tech micro sound wave, whatever the hell that may be. The high tech micro sound wave is another word for an mp three -- three player. It plays music, and therefore it started raining carrots in the entire world. So we have to blame the kangaroos in Australia because it's very hot in there. Seriously. We have to.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG227","Here it is, Friday morning to you. It's XXXX from XXXX dot com coming to you live from, well, you know, my house in New Hampshire. Can we sell this house, yet? Uh, well, what I I'm gonna try to be unplugged this weekend. Um, tomorrow is my boys' double birthday party. Taylor will be one on the nineteenth and A. J. just turned three yesterday. Had some drama today; he, um, wants to play his new Wii game I allowed him to pick out. It's called Pet -- Petz Dogz Two, and, um, unfortunately, brought it home and found out there's a lot of reading involved with the game and he obviously cannot read. My six, almost seven year old, daughter can read, so I had her help him; it just turned into a fight. So I'm coming tell -- tell you, that I'm basically going to try to be unplugged most of the weekend. I'll probably be on Twitter a little bit and Facebook, but overall, I won't be out there too, too much, because this weekend is going to be all about my family. I am going to get back into time to spend weekends with my family, versus working all weekend, because that's what's important, uh, making sure you create those long lasting memories with your little ones before they're -- before you know it, they'll be adults and you'll wonder where the time went. So I invite you to have some family time and if you do get on line, you can stop on over to happilyblended. com. You can watch a little bit of my videos, which will be headlined Saturday morning. You can also check back -- check on my Giving Back project, which I am looking for many people to get involved. My first annual one, next year, I hope to get even bigger. This year I'm focusing on, uh, New Hampshire needy families and I really can use some support in corroding , supporting, um -- just getting the word out. I'd really like to get this big this year. Um, it's very important to me to give back to families that need things. And, um, it's the only one I can think of this year. Hopefully I'll think of other great projects in the upcoming years. So, again, it's XXXX dot com. I'm XXXX, and I'm planning off for the weekend, so have some great fun and times. Bye bye.","High","Low","High"

"VLOG23","Okay guys. So, what I learned today about governments and civilicness -- uh -- yeah -- okay -- well it was a two minute Wikipedia search -- like -- and I've learned what fascism and socialism are, because I really didn't know. And this is what I've come up with, okay. Socialism is -- advocates an economic system where everybody does work and all the resources -- all the profit gained from that work, that everybody does, is available for everybody to draw resource from. So, let's say we're a socialist beet farm -- you know -- beet farming community, and we all farm beets. And so we make a big pile of all our beets and everybody gets a fair share of beets. I mean, that's -- that's what I got.Fascism -- and this is also fascism associated with Social Darwinism -- kind of -- is how I'm -- this is my perception of it. That fascism is when -- I forgot. It slips out of my brain so fast -- how does it happen? Um, fascism is when -- it's this whole -- I don't know. What I got is it's this thing where, you know, they think the weak are puny and the strong are the best. And everybody should be strong and strong versus weak, because the world is always in conflict, or something. And as a -- as a nation -- as a society we should be as strong as possible. Which, I also -- I -- I -- I think, you know, this might be like the darker side but Nazi Hitler side.Um, even though Hitler was a Nazi, not a fascist or -- is he a fascist? I don't fucking care about Hitler. So, um -- you know -- I was thinking that one race is the best. One group of people is the best. You know, they decide what the strongest is. So, that's different, okay. I'll put some Wikipedia links on the side over there, under , you know -- but, uh, yeah -- so I'm gonna put some links to the Wikipedia pages 'cause I think if we all use Wikipedia we'll be super smart or at least on the same page. Like -- seriously, 'cause even if Wikipedia's wrong if everyone believed it it'd be right. For all intents and purposes it'd be right, so - Yee Yee Yee. I don't know, I feel like doing a dance. A dance, dance, dance. Dance, dance, dance, dance. Dance, dance. Pepsi. Ah! Pepsi cola!Okay guys, go take care of the government now. Go fix things. Be citizens. Congratulations. I don't know.

"VLOG233","﻿I've been on YouTube for two years. That's what it tells me, at least. And I realized that two years is a long time of just watching videos, just watching. I've kept a live journal for like, forever, since I was in middle school. And it was good, it was one step closer to discovering who I was, 'cause I'm a creative writer -- it's, it's what I do, but I realized that text was a mask. The pretty words and the pretty metaphors were just a mask I was putting up for myself and I realized that the only way I could really, truly know myself is by looking at myself, watching myself talk.And a lot of your own videos inspired me to do that. It was you that got me into vlogging. I've always kinda wanted to but you convinced me that -- that words only got me so far. Text was hiding behind the screen of my monitor. I think it was that vlog you did, dealing with depression, I loved that one, that one really spoke to me.And you're right -- you know, and I don't always understand your videos, sometimes they could just fly over my head, but I've never bitched about it. You know, the reason why I'm subscribed to you is, like, it's because every time you post a video, I feel -- I wonder if I'll understand you this time.

"VLOG235","﻿This weekend I'm going to the New York City Anime Festival. What is that? It's basically an anime convention. And I've been to a few of these, so I've decided to file this video for tips and tricks to have a wonderful kind of experience.First off is money. It's going to cost money for the tickets. I personally get a weekend pass, so you can go the whole weekend. For Manga Day, you're going to need probably more money or less money depending on the convention prices and the city. I usually set aside an extra twenty bucks, so I can get a t shirt.Transportation is also going to run you some money. Since we're in Manhattan, I can take the subway out there and then hop on a bus and be there in no time. I go there twice a day; that's two twenty five with a transfer, so that's only four fifty a day. I got to put about -- between something about a fifteen dollar metro card -A lot of free stuff, so bring a bag. I have a bag that I use just for this kind of thing, I have a small tin in it, which I use, cause I have a lot of business cards, a lot of small stickers, bookmarks, stuff like that, 'cause this -- they will give -- usually have bags you can get for free, but I prefer -Cause a lot of this stuff -- 'cause this is going to be pretty cool. So, I recommend bringing a camera. I'm bringing a camera -- I'm gonna carry -- I'm gonna carry my camera in this bag; hold it around my neck. So, with your camera in mind, you're gonna need batteries, because the batteries might die or you might friend of your's he might need them, so I -- I try to purchase a twelve pack for the con. Also, a memory card wouldn't hurt -- I plan to bring my spare memory card, in case this one gets full up, 'cause you will be doing a lot of pictures and I plan on doing some filming this weekend.Now, you're going to get hungry. You're walking around all day, you're gonna get hungry. Now there's food there usually -- it's pretty fucking expensive there, so I'm gonna make -- so I would recommend making sandwiches or filling up a glad bag -- chips, trail mix, Power Bars, granola bars, pretzels maybe, stuff like that. Or for me -- now where I'm going there's a McDonalds two blocks away, I go there. You'll find people from the con there; trust me. You can get a quick -- quick lunch, head back to the convention, that's, of course, if you are willing to leave the convention center for it.Also, bring a bottle a water, it's going to be hot in there, there's a lot of people. Well, I guess that's about it. Um, if you have any more tips or tricks, leave a comment or a video response telling me and everyone else who watches this.","Low","High","Low"
"VLOG236","﻿Hey everybody. Op, let me, ah. Hey everybody, its XXXX. Grab yourself a piping hot, ice cold glass of Coca Cola for this fireside chat. Oh my gosh, that's so good. Hah, man that's good. Ice cold Coke in our house is the best. Um, we think so. Although we've been off Coke for -- we were off Coke in the house for months, months, months, months. We were only having, like, Kool Aid and water and stuff like that but it's a -Now the cake's done. Okay the timer stopped. I all ready took it out. I made a cake. Actually I didn't make a cake. I poured it out of the box and mixed it up and put it into a pan. Let's go get it. Let me go get it for you. This chair is so rolly. Look at that. It's covered in cinnamon and, um, it's a cinnamon swirl quick bread. It's got layers of cinnamon in the middle. I think it's going to be good. It's really hot right now.Okay, sorry for that interruption. Um, a couple things going on, today we went to the grocery store. So, we go to different grocery stores depending what's on sale and what we need and so forth.The dog is over in the living room. She takes her toys and then she throws them in the air and chases after them, like, she plays catch with herself. Which is good, it entertains herself but, um, I think she thinks someone else is throwing it and it's her doing it. She's like, oh, they threw it this way this time. I'll go get it. It's funny. She knows I'm talking about, too. I can tell.Um, anyway, a couple things. Ah, I probably all ready started to talk about -- here comes Darla. Here she goes right through the video. Good job, good job. She's got one of those Hawaiian bread rolls, Hawaiian sweet bread, yeah. Do they even have Hawaiian sweet bread in Hawaii? Or is that just something that's got us mainlanders hooked on thinking it's like some special treat from Hawaii when really it's made in Slabtown, North Carolina.Anyway, let me tell -- I know what I was telling you, we went to the grocery store today. We go to different grocery stores based on what we need, what the sales are and so forth. Well tonight, um, we went to Aldi. I don't know if -- probably not all of you have Aldi. I'm not sure. Aldi is like a German or Belgian company, I'm not -- I think it's German. Um, and they like open up these grocery stores here and they're like non frills. No frills at all. Um, they've got their system. They are not going to waver from it. Ah, they don't provide bags free of charge. They don't, um -- you have to put a quarter in the shopping cart or as they call them here in the south, put a quarter in the buggy. You have to put a quarter in the buggy to, ah, release it. Ah, and the reason they do that is so that you will return that cart to the corral to get your quarter back. It has, like, this mechanism to get your quarter back out.Um, they don't have a lot of people working there. When they scan your groceries, they just scan them and throw them into the cart, and then you bag them yourself. It's this whole -- but they have got the whole system. It's good for certain things. Some things we don't like but as it turns out our next door neighbor is the store manager for our -- the Aldi that's close to us. Um, which is funny because he always comes over and we joke with him about this. He will come over, like, ten o'clock at night and be like, do you guys have an egg? Or do you have a cup of milk? What was he here for the other night? Do you have any cooking spray? Don't they have that at the grocery store were you just spent sixteen straight hours? It just always cracks us up because, you know, that's like me coming home from work and calling my neighbor and saying, do you have a piece of copy paper? So, anyway, today I thought it was funny. One of the things that caught my eye in the grocery store was bacon. We don't buy bacon all the time but it is one of my favorite things. So, today, um, I was comparing the prices, looking at the weight. You know, I compare how much is it per, ah -- per ounce and I do all of that when I grocery shop just because, you know, sometimes it's deceiving. If you've got -- bacon is pretty much all the same, I thought until today. Now, I know better. Um, but you know you've got your hickory smoked, you've got your thick sliced, you've got your, uh, maple cured. Huh?Brown maple cured.Yeah, cured -- all these different kinds. Well, I found a new kind today, yep. The economy has finally taken a toll on the bacon industry. This is the bacon I ended up with. See if you can see this. It's economy sliced. It's economy sliced bacon. Which from what I can tell -- I haven't opened it yet, but what I can tell is that it's sliced super duper thin. It's economy sliced.Well, I didn't even see the economy sliced thing until I got home. Um, but it's a pound, uh, which is interesting because bacon lately has been twelve ounces, it seems like. And this is a whole pound of bacon and it was under two dollars; I'm pretty sure. Like, maybe it was two point two four. I don't know; pretty good price. When we get it on sale you can get it for like two for four dollars, but then it's like twelve ounces. But this is a whole pound. Um, but it's economy sliced. It's economy sliced. Never -- never heard of that. Um, I guess they're just using any old -- any old economy related word they can to hock their product. It's economy sliced.Oh, something else new about me. I like jazz music now. I'm a jazz connoisseur. Well, not exactly, but I have one CD. We were in Barnes and Noble yesterday -- yesterday? Yeah, yesterday and, um, I said, I like jazz now. I want to buy a jazz CD. The very first one in my life and I owned hundreds of CDs. So, I got this, Paul Hardcastle The Collection. And I got it because it was the first one that I put in and listen to on the, ah, Barnes and Noble -- you know you can scan any CD in the music section and hear what's on it. Well it was the first one that I scanned and I thought, that sounds like jazz. I like it; I bought it. Um, so that's what plays in my car now. Um, until I get tired of that.Um, what else? And, um, maybe that's it? I'm, uh -- I'm trying to blog more, can you tell? Ah, the cake, the bacon, the jazz. I worked today a little bit. That was all. Okay, I'm going to let you go; keep this shorter than it was and I'll to try to edit some stuff out to make it even shorter. Um, just to let you know its seven minutes and forty three seconds, so when you watch this edited video, you see how much I cut out. I don't know yet. Okay, peace out, Westside and Vogue. Um, you know Madonna, um, started the whole Vogue thing. How it made its way into my videos, I don't know. Um, I don't particularly like that song. Um, I -- I don't know how that Vogue thing started, um, but now I'm thinking, um, I'm going to pick up something new like that peace out, Westside and, I don't know. I'm gonna -- give me a suggestion, okay.Lady Ga Ga.Lady Ga Ga. Okay, 'cause I'll need about, you know, a spackle and a gallon of makeup. All right, bye. It's economy sliced. It's economy sliced.And it was on the left and I just reached over and grabbed it and then I just remember -Yup, it was a dollar eighty nine.","Low","Low","High"

So, like, that's pretty fucked up, I mean, I -- you, you know I was against it, so I hate the new design, it's just a sham and it's -- it's a pain in the arse, okay, that's it.Um -- so what I'm gonna talk about now, which is gonna get on to the subject of the video, is Veo, uh, if you haven't heard of Veo, it's a video site -- slightly like YouTube although they have um, the ability to support videos up to whatever, hours and hours.

It -- you know, it's kinda scary because, you know, you're forced to just grow up so fast and it just -- it's like a reality check that you're not ready for. But um, you know, I want to thank everybody who has been friends with me for the past, well I can say, twenty years. I mean, I've had ups, downs, I've lost friends, I've gained friends. I mean, my last couple of weeks have not been the best.I got in a pretty rough car accident a few weeks back. Well, not even weeks back, it was like, last week, on Wednesday. But, yeah, I was about three inches from having my windshield bust out and, it -- it -- it literally like woke me up because I'm just like, holy crap, I could've probably died.So, you know, you gotta really watch how you take life, cause you could take it for granted and the next day it would be over. So, it's just something you gotta keep in mind, you know? But, I -- turning twenty . It's scary, I know. For me, I'm like scared shitless, I'm not ready. I'm not.

It was Florida and it was supposed to be warm, but it was freezing. I mean, we were all frozen, like, solid, like I couldn't move my toes because I was so cold. I also wore my converses, which probably weren't exactly the most, uh, insulated shoes. It was pretty fun. Like, everybody was into it, it was good.

"VLOG242","Hey guys, you knew this rant was coming. My rant about women, women in general. Now let me start off with women are very judgmental. Oh no, no I'm not, no I always care about the person's personality. To and extent, you guys don't give a fuck about the personality of a man. Okay, you can walk into a room, three guys sitting there and you know all of them. First one kind of looks like Robert Pattinson a little bit and he's kind of a jerk. Middle one kind of and average Joe not the best looking, but he's there but he doesn't have the personality of being your boyfriend. Third one, kind like a little bit over weight, ugly but really funny, really nice personality and cares about people. Who are you going to go for? You're going to go for the Robert Pattinson guy because he's the guy that you can take back to your friends and gloat, look at my hot ass boyfriend. Yet he's probably going to cheat on you because that's what hot, jerk, assholes do. They are, like, I have one girl, let's see if I can get two. Even four who the fuck knows? So then you're left traumatized for having your heart broken by this guy to not wanting to date any other guy for the rest of your life. Now guys like me, we know that we are not going to be the first choice -- first pick of any girl but we know that later in life that the stupid girls from high school are going to come flying back to us because girls are really fucking stupid in high school when it comes to guys anyway. They go for the hot guy, the guy that will cheat on her, the guy that will break her heart. Later in life she'll realize, oh, we wanted one of the average Joe or the not so good looking guy because they're the people that are going to care -- those're the people who're going to care for your family. They're the ones that you want to live with. They're the ones that you actually want to have a life with. But you're not going to realize this 'til your about in your thirties so ladies I'd give you advice now. Uh, don't always go for the hottest piece of ass guy that you can -- that you can find. Because most likely, they won't treat you as most other ones will. Okay, girls are always like I want to go for the football player, I want to go for the basketball player, I want to go for somebody who has a good job because you're always money hungry and you're always power hungry. If you can get yourself famous or something, he'll go for it. But there are some girls out there who think, hey I care about the personality, I don't care about looks. Well, you do. Yeah, you go to the mall and your always going to be, like, look at that cute guy over there. You may not fall in love with him, but if he greets you in a nice manner and he seams like a nice guy your head over heals in love with him already. That's how guys have the greatest power over women. They use their looks and their quick charm to try to take over a girl's life. Well her heart, not necessarily her life. It's to their advantage and keep them on a leash for a long time and it's not a good sign. And it makes the rest of us look really bad. It makes all of us look like we're a bunch of jerks. Like, girls have always said, I hate all men; all men are assholes, all men will cheat on you, well no, they won't. A good -- a good amount probably will. A large amount of men will think with their dick head and not their really head first which is not all of us. You have to remember that, that not all guy are bad guys -- just those ones that use their power and their looks to their advantage. I know some guys who found out, hey, I'm good looking and they use it to their advantage in the wrong ways. They break girls' hearts left and right, cheat on them and then convince them to come back with them which is not cool one bit, if you want to, you don't deserve the one your given. That one should stay in your heart alone. Now I may come out as kind of a douche bag or something in this video, but I'm not trying to. I'm trying to convince somewhat of high school type women to realize that, hey, it's not always the smartest to go after the hottest guy or the guy who will give you popularity. Go for the ones that you truly feel in your heart are the better people, not always go for the best ones. And also stop leading the other ones on. While you're waiting for you sweat heart to fall to his knees, you have to find a friend too. You find that -- you take that ugly guy. You take the one who has a good personality who will help you move up the ladder. The one who will make you feel good about yourself so much to the point that you will have enough confidence to go for that top guy. But it will make the guy on the bottom feel like you care about him. Feel that he has a chance. When really he doesn't have a chance in the world. You're just using him which is not cool. I know not all ladies do this, but I know quite the few that have. Now I'm not trying to say that all girls are bitches. I'm not trying to say -- I'm not trying to blame it on anything. A lot of guys use their looks to their advantage. A lot of girls play with their looks and their charm on guys who move up levels and that's not right and I hope some day you can realize that and maybe even notice some of these people around your school. People who have used this against their advantage and try to help other friends stay away from these problems. If you see a friend going for some guy who is known for cheating, keep the girl away from him. And girls just leading guys', on it's not fun and of course you crush your guys heart into a powdery substance shit. Now this was more of a serious rant than a comedic rant. Sorry. I really need to get some of this shit out I hope you still comment, rate, subscribe, um, make a response. I would love a response. It would be sweet if you could make a video response to this. And uh, this is -- this is XXXX and hopefully I don't have to make another serious pissed off rant again.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG243","﻿Hey guys, it's XXXX here and guess what? I'm back. Right, you're probably wondering why I haven't posted a ton of new videos. Well, I will tell you and let you in on a little secret. College is crazy. See, they pile on us a ton of work and expect you to have it all done. Don't they know I have YouTube videos to be making? I mean seriously, I have to have my priorities straight. Anyways, so this book is what's getting in the way, because I'm having to read history, huh, and to be honest, I wish history didn't exist. I hate reading about it. It's the most boring topic and I'm sorry if you guys like history, but I don't. But anyway, in other news, I got a new video camera about two days ago. Actually one day ago. I got it last night, I believe and, um, I love it. It works with my Mac and that was the biggest problem with my other video camera, so now I'm able to video tape on the go, which, you know, that's going to make my videos more interesting. So anyway, I promise you there is new content. I'm kind of working on more of the technical aspects at the moment. I'm trying to get new pictures made, new graphics; things like that. I know those aren't really that interesting, but I do want my profile to be a little bit more representative of me so anyway I guess, um, that's all.

"VLOG244","There were two in the bed and the little one said, It's time for a blog.  Hello, I'm starting to become rather lonely doing these blogs. I mean, I knew a little friend from, like, back there. It's just kinda, you know, sad, me sitting here talking to a computer all day without anyone else to speak to. It's not fair; I have a lollypop.Ah, something interesting has popped up. Today I opened the door and there stood my friends, Katy and Sophie. And one of them said; Hello, David. There's a little bird in your path.  And of course I replied, What?  Yes, dear. It's a little blackbird and it's not moving.  So, at this point, I went, Oh my God, there's a blackbird in my path.  And there was a blackbird in my path. And it was a little, fuzzy bird, and it had a big ; you know, I mean, a big .Anyway, that blackbird has been outside, not moving, for about nine hours. No, no, no, no, no. It was outside for about five hours, until my dad decided to bring it in the house, so now we have a blackbird in my house underneath a little crate with all this newspaper and -- and little bits of bread to feed it. It can't fly. It just hops about, because . And it's -- it's nice, but it's not. It could have diseases, like, I don't know, like .Anyway, basically. if it can't fly, but it's still able to live, we have to keep it. Which I can't do, because I don't want a blackbird flying about in my house. .You just need to . I have an Eiffel Tower in my pants. Do you like my shirt?The Zebra Ice Cube man will return after this short commercial: And today is November of two thousand and nine in the month of July . Yeah, I had to make this video because I was extremely bored. And I have not made one in about -- whoo oo -- a week. Ah, someone is speaking to me on MSN . Isn't this fun? No. Do you like my new theme tune? I did that myself. It's quite catchy, isn't it? Uh hum. I have a lollypop. I probably said that, but I have a lollypop. Uh oh, I broke my mouse.The color of white. There're just over seven weeks 'till Christmas. Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas. . You know, I couldn't really think of anything to say, but I guess that's it. With that, I'll start this again.

"VLOG246","Hello, um, so I haven't made a video, like just a random video, in a long time, so I decided that because I am kind of hyper right now, ah, that, ah, I am going to make a video. Okay? So my dad was going through his apartment because his roommate moved out awkwardly and just left all of his stuff and he was going through all this crap that we're not friends and stuff and he came across these Mighty Morphin Power Rangers marbles and he gave them to me and I'm kind of excited about it. It's because its like retro , like seriously, Power Rangers? And they are in marbles? Okay, and I think that it was destined for me to have them cause as you can see, possibly, it says Zach on the top one, like, and that wasn't even the good one, the red one was always the like leader of everything and the black one, um, was just kind of there. Was the black one actually black? I don't remember. Write something in the comments if you remember if the black one was black. I kind of think that he was. Racist? Maybe.In school today we were going through, doing the presses and my hand are blue because of it. We were running the presses and I got to print out this, um, Nintendo thingy and it was blue, hence blue ink on my hands still. Anyway, once I was done I went out to one of the computers and started making these, you see right here, the top one is Mr. Ashwave and the bottom one is Blackwidow and um, these are Christmas gifts for my family cause we all came up with superhero names one day and I decided to make them into t shirts and give them, and give them to them for Christmas, obviously. Ha ha, cool, nerd, cool, nerd, gremlin.What else do I have to talk about? Oh, I am going to do this live, live to me and not live to you, of course, so here I have got my itchy hat, ha, ha, ha. I just updated them right now, so they should all be correct. So, um, let's just go through and pick one randomly. Okay, let's pick this one. And this one is Cassie out da Box, not the Box, da box, man, geeze, get in times.Well, the last thing that I want to talk about is that I'm in a program that involves like a lot of printing paper and designing things to be put on paper so, um, all the, like, different students print out random things like this and these. So I have, like, lots of paper. I have, like, paper coming up the Ying Yang. Why I have paper in the Ying Yang I don't know. You probably don't want to know even if I did know, so no. So I know this video made absolutely no sense and that there is no flowing movement through it but, um, I though I would just kind of randomly make a video because I haven't made a vlog in a long time. Um, so, um, I will see you guys later, okay? Graaaaaa. Hello YouTube, that was weird, okay.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG247","Oh, hi there internet. Aha. How are you doing? I am fine. Yeah. I just want to tell you a little story about something that happened to me this afternoon that I found quite weird and strange and very much shareable, if that's a word or it's just something I'd like to share with you. Let's put it that way, because I'm a sharer, if that's even a word. But, if there was such a word as sharer, I am one, because I like to share crap that happens to me. Moving on.See I have this book, but it's not my book. I'm sure it's a fantastic book, um, but it's not mine and the owner left it at our place and I wanted to send it back to the owner today, because I'm a nice person and that's what nice people do. They send books back to the people that own them. Right? Yeah.So, I went to the post office, because this is a nice book. I mean, I'm -- I can show it back to you again. It's a nice book, it's a hardcover book and, um, I don't have, like, a ton of boxes that I could just use or -- I didn't want to wrap it up in some stuff and just, you know, send it and wish myself good luck that it gets there in one piece and then, you know, leave it at that. No, no, no. I thought, hey, go to the post office; get a nice little package thing for the book and, you know, write a few words then send it back to the person that, uh, the book belongs to.Now, I don't know what kind of experiences you guys have had, but post offices, so far, like mine all have been rather negative, but today topped everything I've ever seen happening in a post office. So, I took that book and went to the next post office. I entered and it was amazing. I've never seen so many people waiting in line to send their crap to other people. I've never, never seen anything like it, seriously. And, there are only three people working, so it was really, really -- it was really slow process going on, really slow process.But, I thought, okay, you know? I have my iPhone. I can listen to music and I can check my emails and I can read things on Twitter. I'm good. I'm good. Only problem is when there are so many people in one tiny room and they're all wrapped up in their winter clothing, they tend to sweat and, unfortunately, stink. So it was -- just -- arrgh -- the air in there was just disgusting. The air was smelling like sweat and warm clothing, you know, like, the wool thing tends to smell sometimes.And, um, breath, not only just breath, you know, like, a room filled with people that were wearing clothes, and they're sweating and talking to each other or breathing in general. And to me I don't -- I'm not so good with a lot of people in a tiny space. I tend to get nauseous and that was just, you know, the whole temperature thing. It -- it was not a really good combination.And to top that off, I'm standing there, in line, waiting for about 60 minutes and I didn't even get half way through the entire line. But, I was thinking, you know what? Calm down; you've got time, you don't need to hurry up. It's gonna be your turn eventually.So, after sixty minutes a boy at the age of -- I'd say four or maybe five -- that was also waiting in line with his mother, I guess, um; he was standing, like, two meters next to me and all the sudden he threw up on the floor out of nowhere. It was probably not out of blue for him, but for me it was. It was, like, this explosion of thrown up things on the floor and then there were people and more people and the mother and she was all, like, oh no. And the boy was, like, crying and it was horrible. And the smell -- oh God, the smell -- and it was disgusting.Now, I don't know about you, but I'm one of those people that's not, just like, oh well, there is someone who is throwing up, doesn't concern me. No. If I see, hear and smell someone throwing up right next to me, it does concern me, because it's kinda sickening. And I'm, like, no, I don't want to be here. Can you please stop throwing up? I don't wanna look, but I have to. I don't wanna look, I have to. Oh God, I can smell him. It doesn't matter if I look or not.You know, right after that happens, my mood kinda went like this. It was just bleah; it was nasty and I just wanted to go home. And I was so annoyed, so, you know, I thought, oh, I'm gonna have to stand here for another hour. Really? Just because of a freakin' book? No. So I was frustrated and mad and annoyed, and I just went home and took a shower. Because, I felt really gross. That was just a really nasty afternoon and I just wanted to get that off. I just really wanted to get that off me, uch, it was, ooh, fuck, because I could've waited longer and just sent the damn book back. But, at that moment -- at that very moment, I did not think that far.And, I'm sitting here thinking do post offices even open Saturdays?","High","High","High"
"VLOG248","﻿Is this thing on? Welcome to a not very interesting video. Um, I've made a few videos over the past few weeks, but, um, I was too lazy to edit any of them, like, right after I made them, so, um, now it's too late. I'm not going to edit any of them and I won't upload any of them.This is my apology for what you could have had, but you don't have it because I am a lazy thing, person, woman, girl, man. So instead of uploading, uh, one of the videos that I was supposed to upload ages ago. because I'm fat talking to the camera. .I'm making this very short video about my hair cut because, uh, I cut my hair and that's more video worthy than the other videos, I guess. I got bangs again. It's a bit annoying already, actually. It's way too short and I don't like it and um, there's really nothing I can do about it.More than you can handle, so let's do it like I drew it in the general, general.

"VLOG249","Hi YouTube. So, first off, it's been a while and I apologize for that and I didn't intend for it to happen. But alas, it did. After I made my first video I didn't really know what to put up next 'cause I had nothing to talk about. And I'd rather put out quality videos that I think people will enjoy rather than just turning out crap every week so there is something out there. So, I didn't make one for about three weeks or so. Then I had some friends who asked me if they could borrow my camera to film something for a scholarship and of course I was like Oh, yeah, higher education. Of course, it's a worthy cause.  So, I gave them my camera and then Marvin was gone for three weeks. So, I just got him back the other day and I'm so happy that he's here and everything just great. Moral of the story is never let your friends borrow your camera.Probably the biggest news I have for you is that on this past Sunday, ah, I went and saw Demitri Martin in Portland and XXXX and XXXX were there too and that was great. And he was as I expected, a very very funny man. And if you ever get the chance to go see him I would recommend doing so. But the best part of it was, after we left the show my friend Harry and I -- that's who I went with -- my buddy Harry. Ah, we were walking by the theater and noticed there were like twenty people outside these shifty looking doors and we wanted to know what was going on. So, we stood there and it was just this guy who was noticeably not Demitri Martin loading things from the store into this car with a driver. From the door to the car, it's a dance. We started looking at the stuff that he was loading in there and it was stuff like Demitri's keyboard, Demitri's guitar. So, I looked at Harry and we both got really excited. And then the guy came out and whispered something to the driver, who drove around the block really fast. So, we followed the driver to the other side of the theater. And then out comes Demitri Martin in all his shining glory and he's just like hey guys. Pictures ensued and people shook his hand and got his autograph. And the best part for me was he drew on my phone. Although nobody will believe that Demitri Martin drew on my phone, so I will be battling for that story this coming school year.I'd like to talk about something that I've noticed that I think is despicable. We all know that the elderly are not as acute as they once were. If you -- they don't remember things -- it's -- you know, it's just how it is. And sometimes they get a little bit confused. A good example of this is when my brother asked my grandma for Battlefield Two for Christmas and she got him Battlefront Two, which is okay 'cause they're both good games. It's an easy mistake to make. This is completely innocent. The games just happen to be titled similarly. But some companies have gone out of their way to make products that imitate other products to confuse grandmothers. A case in point, I was at the store the other day and at the end of the checkout counter where they always put the little weird toy things on sale, was a movie. Everybody's familiar with Pixar's Up -- there's a, whew, poster for it there. That's what Up looks like. And then this movie was called What's Up. And I'm not okay with that because the covers look similar, they're titled similarly. Who's to know what's the real product, if you're not really familiar with it. So, I've decided that is very bad and there should be laws against it. Get to work on it, Obama.It's just dawning on me that I actually haven't spoke about how the gathering went yet. Um -- it was phenomenal. I had loads of fun and I hope everybody else did too. And I just wanted to thank everybody who was there. There were more people than we could've ever anticipated. That was fantastic. Ah, we're planning for next year already and we'll get that information out as soon as we can to allow ample time for traveling preparations to be made because you want to be there. You want to be there.Okay, here's another gripe. I went in to get my school schedule yesterday and I noticed that there are a lot of classes on there that I didn't forecast for. And some of them are classes that I had completed freshman year, which I thought was strange. So, I went to the schedule changing station and I said what's up guys? And apparently three of the media classes that I had forecasted for did not exist. I'm just confused, why would they put them in the catalogue if they weren't real. They're like decoy classes. I'm not -- I don't know why they would try to trick me. But apparently what happened was not enough kids signed up for those classes, which was unfortunate because that was, like, half my schedule so I to get that whole mess reworked. But in the end it was fine and now I get to sleep in every other day because I have a first period open.And now to end on a sad note, one of my favorite YouTubers, Lamar, also known as Wilson Tech 1 has shut down everything internet related. And I have not been able to contact in any way. But if he still watches these videos, Lamar, this is for you. Good bye and best wishes. I hope that I'll get a job at Subway in Chicago and maybe I'll see you someday.All right. That's it. Bye.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG25","Hey, just want to say Happy Halloween to all y'all. I just got nothing going on here so I'll probably be bored tonight.

Uh, that's what you get for living in Orange County, right?Uh, anyways, just want to say happy Halloween, have fun whatever you're doing. Don't break too many laws.

"VLOG250","Hello, faculty of Business and Law, especially Milanese's Law School crew. My name is, uh, XXXX, and this video is here like, is my audition of the Uni, your voice video. Now, a little bit about myself. I'm third year Leeds math student studying law, and it's going pretty well, you know, in typical student style, you know. The work is piling up to about what, this high? No, I'm exaggerating. But, um, yeah, it's getting tough. So -- really important year, so I'm just trying my best, just doing the best that I can. But also, I do other things, both on the law side and on the business side as well, which is quite interesting.Um, first of all, um, I've been doing since the first year Street Law, and uh, if you're wondering what Street Law is, it's basically a group of us go around to many different colleges, different schools, and even did my first for the University itself, and doing presentations on certain legal topics that might affect that particular group. My last presentation was in Roundhay School, and we did one on Worker's Awareness; and that was in my second year. And it was pretty good, you know. The kids were fine; they didn't misbehave or anything. And that school it's actually quite -- pretty big. It actually reminds me of Heatonly . So, yeah.And, um, secondly, I'm also doing Business Data Workshop. I'm not presenting it, I'm actually attending it. some tips on how maybe being self employed could be a potential career option and I'm seriously considering it. It sounds very exciting, yet very risky, so that's going good. I think the next one is actually today, at two o'clock. I think it's about, ironically enough, legal issues so that would be quite interesting.And also on the business side, I'm also part of a team in the IBM University Business Challenge. Which is basically a nationwide challenge, throughout many, like, a good couple hundred -- maybe on three hundred -- universities competing and doing business simulations. I have certain ideas about we're, like, consultants trying to run a business. And it's going pretty good. Um, we just had the photo shoot, think the other day, think few days ago. And, um, something quite funny happened. I'm not going to go into detail on that, but let's just say someone didn't actually come in properly dressed. That's all I'm going to say for that. I don't want to embarrass the person in question.So, um, in my spare time, I actually, funny enough, do things like this. You know, if you check me, I'm also known on YouTube as XXXX, and on YouTube I just do various different blogs and reports. I do an extract of , I might put some stuff on annotations and stuff, so you can see it. But, um, yeah; that's what I do in my spare time.And why do I want to be part of this faculty video? Well, first of all it seems like a lot of fun. I mean, now I do this just in my room on my own. It would be good to take up a notch, maybe do something that's part of the university and maybe interview, maybe outside the Rose Bowl, in the main square. That would be pretty fun. And maybe for my own personal YouTube videos; I dunno. It's also a potential, maybe, job or career option, uh, being , 'cause it's some kind of job, you know. The key thing for me in life is to look forward to Monday mornings. You know, be out there, be like yes, Monday, time for work. And it's -- it's a big dream; don't get me wrong, but it's a dream none the less.So that's the -- that's the main thing I wanna say. Hopefully it's not too long. But I'm hoping I'm not too late. I know this e mail came out a few weeks back, so I hope I'm too late. I've just been busy; I didn't get around to doing this now, so hopefully that master class will help me build my confidence up at well, 'cause people say I'm quite quiet, and people don't see me talk and do out -- outish things and stuff. So hopefully I'll get through. So, I'll see you guys soon and, uh,","High","High","High"
"VLOG251","﻿Hey there, so Ms. XXXX put me up to a challenge in her video, link's down there, cause this is going to be a video response.Um, she wants people to try to eat bananas, which I have all cut up in fun with ketchup, which is probably as gross as it sounds, but -- and as gross as it looks. But she wants a lot of ketchup on there, and well, don't want to disappoint, so I'm just going to -- oh God. Okay, okay.It almost looks like cherry sauce stuff and that with bananas would probably be good, so I'm going to imagine that this is cherry sauce. My taste buds don't want it to be -- to be cherry sauce. Oh God, I like ketchup too, but, oh God, no. Okay, I'm not going to recommend that to anybody, ever, no day , no.

"VLOG252","﻿Hey, YouTube. Um, right, okay. Just a quick video, really, just to sorta say sorry . Um, you'll see why. Because this is a pre hiatus video. Um, at least I'm informing you. It can't be helped, because I'm going to university tomorrow, and I won't really be able to make videos for a little while; I'm not sure how long.Um, two reasons for this, really. First, is I don't -- I won't have a camera when I get to university, not a big one, um, because I'm using the family camera at the moment. And obviously I can't take that with me because it's the family's, not mine. Um, but I'm going to buy a camera. I can probably do better than this, one to be fair, so .Uh, secondly is internet. I'm not sure when or, well -- or whether I will have it, um, because I haven't got my laptop. I'm using a home for internet now, but my laptop is the one I'll be having at uni and I don't know whether the internet is going to work on it 'cause it's a bit iffy. Hopefully, it will work, there's a slight chance it won't. And I'm also -- I'm not sure how quickly they gonna give me internet at uni as well.Sorry. That's the reasons. Sorry. Don't unsubscribe; I will be back and I'll be awesome in a new location. Um, so you know, don't unsubscribe. Uh, I love you -- all of you -- so much. Um, but so just wait. Ah, yeah.

"VLOG254","I'm on holiday this week. Um, the company I work for is currently on strike which is all over the news anyway. Um, you know. Luckily the public is starting to realize what really is going on. Um, you know there's some support there. It's kind of um, it's all been sort of orchestrated by high level people; I can't go into too much because it's a bit political and um, obviously I work for them so I'm not gonna sort of go on about it. But I think this is -- th -- th -- this -- the news has been really funny all day alright, but just a minute ago apparently, due to the postal strikes 'cause the swine flu vaccination thing started on Monday I think, they hadn't received all the doses they was expecting due to the postal strikes.Please. We don't deliver vaccines. What, what. That's just -- they just said that on the news. And I'm like oh, they might have to ring people with severe illnesses, to let them come in for the vaccine because of the postal strike. And I'm like if anything, that's probably a good thing for the public because if anyone has the vaccine, it's not the best move, um, obviously you've got freedom of speech and it's down to you as an individual and if you want to take the vaccine take the vaccine but, um, I don't see that as a problem.The other thing is, um, last night we've got a party in this country, we've got a few parties, we've got Conservative Party, Labour Party, Green Party, Lib. Dems. , I think there's a Legalize Cannabis Party. There used to be the Raving Looney party and then -- oh what's the other one -- um there's the British National Party which is the BNP which is the one that um, was deemed racist. Still is a bit, well it is quite a lot to be honest. It's even against gay people, you know, and not just racist. Um, and there's another one, um, that's something to do with the United Kingdom. I can't -- British Independent I think it's called. Anyway, the BNP were on this program called Question Time which is on BBC where basically the public can ask questions because they've got more seats, they were allowed on it. And there was a riot outside BBC, saying don't show this man on telly because um he's racist and whatever else. Now because we live in quite a diverse country England, we've got every race possible here, um. You know after the War a lot of different cultures were brought over to this country etcetera, etcetera and obviously the second and third generations are here.There's also a lot of asylum seekers, um, people who have immigrated from Eastern Bloc and things like that. And. They're not bad Polish, really, but most of the Polish work and try and sort of make their own sort of sit on benefit. Asylum seekers piss me off because they're the sort of people who come over here, oh my God, you know my life's so shit, er, er. I need to come to your country and then try and change our country to how shit their country is. That doesn't make any sense to me. But, he was on telly and I'm not really a supporter of him, but he did make a couple of true statements in some respects about how the Muslim faith is perceived in the sense of um that women are second class citizens in that faith, that if you're not of Muslim faith then you're an infidel or something. He referred to a few things there that you know, um, a lot of English people relate to you know, when in Rome do as the Romans do. I have absolutely no problem with what someone's culture is, but just don't enforce it upon me because if I wanted to live in a say Indian culture, I'd go to India and live. I wouldn't move to India because I couldn't be who I am because their culture I'd have to respect it. So that's the only problem I have with race. Um, but some people see that as racist apparently. I think everyone's racist to some extent, aren't they?In the middle of a crisis if you had a load of black people and a load of Chinese people, and a load of white people, you'd find that if there was some kind of -- something happened between the two cultures, they'd blame the other culture and stick together. It's human nature, I think even animals do it. This doesn't mean you're racist. It's when you're aggressive towarStop smiling in the background.Hello.Um, who's this? What's the other thing? What was on the news as well? Oh the weather forecast. Please. Get. What. What. Right today he's quite normal, no chem. trails, quite warm for October twenty third to be honest. Apparently it's going to be fourteen degrees tonight, you know it's been above three every night this week. There's gonna be fourteen degrees tonight, excuse me. And there's torrential rain on its way that's gonna get the whole of England. And then, from tomorrow there's gonna be this effect of wind that's doing this, this big fucking either tornado that's getting quicker and quicker in the middle, that looks like a tornado. Oh, and gale force winds and torrential rain and a weather warning to finish it. You know sorry, but that was a bit of a weird weather forecast.Seriously, if you get a chance check it today, 'cause it was just like what? Do you know what I mean? So and then -- in Leeds, right, the Post Office are on strike. The bin men are on strike. What was the other thing?South Yorkshire, the firemen there. . .Oh yeah, the firemen are on strike. It's like okay, um. What was the other thing? Oh yeah, the Land Revenue I think in Norfolk maybe going on strike or to industrial action if something isn't sorted out to do with job loss. UK's recession seeks supplantive culture of economal -- economical decline. Our GDP has plummeted by naught point four percent and therefore it's gonna rise, right? You know, I've been going on to everyone, we're not out of no -- there's no financial collapse has happened yet. Just wait 'cause it's gonna be fucking horrendous right? All this bullshit they've done has done nothing, which we all knew it would do nothing and now it's all escalating. Watch it escalate more and more, and more and more.I've gotta go -- I've gotta work work four days a week now for the next however it is until they stop fucking striking. I personally still think we should just take Royal Mail's mail out and bollocks to the others, to the regulator, you know. At the end of the day I think the nearer to Christmas it comes, I think postmen might even do that. Um, I don't know. But yeah, it's all a bit of a mess. Um, I don't know if there's anything else. Is there anything else that's gone on this week?I don't think so.It's just all -- it's the first time I've seen the sky for four days. It's all like autumny, look. You can see that we're going into the shortest area, look. You see all the autumn. Autumn, look. My car is over there, see my van? And my c -- my wire and my car, the silver and the white one, I've got my car there. Now look the sky has kind of not got anything in it, no chem. trails, no nothing. It's quite nice and pleasant out there and there's a breeze. Oh. A nice freight train going by, so thanks. Let's see what they're going out of, a Redland Aggregates.They're not making as much money. That train was half the size they usually are. Oh another one -I feel like a trains bar. Do I look like one? Sorry, did you say yes?Don't look at me like that.Look, YouTube, I've got a bed now, a double bed look, wow. Look, yeah, I got a new double bed today. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, um. What else. There's not really much going on. Actually I wasn't -- I dunno. Anyone remember the New World game cards, um, that were quite sort of -- if you looked at them you'd think oh, 'cause they're quite similar to some events that have occurred. Um, but there was one that said pandemics, economical collapse, civil unrest, natural disasters, oh there's been another earthquake in Indonesia today. That would be the what, third?More than that.More.There's been more than that .There must have been four or five earthquakes in the last four or five weeks. What. You what? You know what I mean. Six point and seven point and eight, what. . . they're not small earthquakes. Uh, I don't know. You know maybe back to report something over the weekend, I'll let you know what the tornado is like that was approaching us that no one seems -- it looks like a tornado. You know obviously it isn't. Well. It's a slim possibility. Government focuses growth by the end of the year. At what, growth from what? Service sector behind unexpected economy. . .Only economy thing is gonna rise by the end of the. . .Yeah because of Christmas. There'll be a surge of people who buy things which will put the GDP up, of course it will. Everyone spends at least a fucking thousand pound at Christmas. So, you know, do the maths, sixty six million people spending a thousand pound each, quite a lot of money. There's gonna be a peak.And then it's gonna go swoosh as everyone can't pay back their credit. Then by March oh dear, are we fucked? So yeah, um, yeah, quite interesting then over in England, it's a bit sort of em, yeah. Anyways sort of like I'm gonna go now 'cause I think ten minutes and I've blogged about absolutely nothing. I think. But then I'm just not here . I gotta go back to work on Monday, they're on strike today but yeah. At least I'm not suffering having next week off. I'm a postal worker, I work indoors, um, doing special deliveries and apparently we're striking next Saturday so that's great. It's ten hour shift, though, that I don't have to do. Means I only get paid for thirty hours but I've got the money, I can survive. 'Cause I live to my millions. Okay, thank you, good night. Peace, love and light, say goodbyGoodbyHold on.

"VLOG255","﻿Hey, Guys! How's it going? I am going to make a video, because I am frustrated at something; something that I'm really, really feeling guilty of. Something I'm guilty of and it kind of goes all around the world of everyone being guilty of this. I work at a place, I'm not going to say the name, I work in this place where I make coffee and I serve doughnuts and I do drive through. We make sandwiches. It's just a nice place and its good and it's very famous in Canada. I have issues with some customers and the way they do things. So, the first one is talking to us like we are idiots. We have brains. We know -- we know what you want. You just have to explain it better or speak louder. If we ask you to repeat something, it's not because we want you to change your words around and say oh, let me put this in layman terms for you. Like, I had that when I was on drive through. They weren't speaking very loud. So, I asked politely, could you please repeat your order. And then they start talking to me, like I'm this idiot, just like this. Some people, when I'm at the drive through window and I check out what their order is and I look at the price of what it is and I go, like, hi it's this amount, please. And then, normally I just stick my hand out and they slap it in my hand, okay? There are sometimes when people, just dump it on the counter, like the window ledge counter, when my hand is right there -- out. It's like, hi my hand's here. You can put it in my hand, but no. Would you like me to hand you your coffee the same way, just oh, oh I thought you were going to catch that, oops.Another thing is when there some customers who think that I can change the store like moving around where the air vents are, or where the tables are that are stuck to the ground, or how everything is laid out. Yes, because I am at the bottom of the food chain of our working company, like our working line and you are me asking me to figure out how to fix it. That's gonna work. This one lady came in and her complaint was really funny. It was, I just sat on your garbage cans outside and I got gum stuck to my pants. Why were you sitting on the garbage can? I had to hold it together, 'cause I was gonna burst out laughing.That was an interesting one but I mean there are things that we do as workers that are good. Like, I'm really good, I've gotten really high marks in, like, customer service. So, I try to please people as much as I can. I'm just a people pleaser, it's what I do. I've-- I've gotten so mad at people I work with who are just being rude. It's just, it's unnecessary for us to be rude to them, even if you're having a stressful day. I mean, everyone comes in expecting good service and I think that we should give them good service.Some people, I don't think realize how stressed out, um, you can get when you working in just a fast food restaurant. And how, how it is, it's a hard job. People think like, oh flipping burgers, whatever. No, it's a lot of standing on you feet for a long time and remembering certain things, of how to make things and all the stuff. And it's -- It's a hard job, it's not easy. Um, and we get -- constantly we get stepped on by rude people who just, I guess don't understand. And I was just, I don't know.Today, I just feeling like, you know what, something needs to be said. Because, I'm sick of being stepped on; I'm sick of being spat on. I just want to be able to do my job. And if I could reach out to one person; please say thank you. Please say please, it just makes our day better. Trust me, those two words just please and thank you; make everything so much better.And if we make a mistake, a slight mistake, like in the order taking and we say, oh, we'll fix it. And we're doing it for free, don't yell at us 'cause we're fixing it for free because we are the ones who made the mistake. We're human; we are not robots and we kinda make mistakes. I don't know. I just wanted to give a little shout out to the underdogs in all of the working industry I guess. Yeah, so I have decided that I really want to make videos more and more. So, I'm trying to think of things to talk about and this one seemed to stand out today. So, let me know what you think. Tell me if you're insulted 'cause I just insulted a bunch of customers who do those things. Or you could tell me about your experiences on the other side or on my side. So, let me know if you've ever worked in a place like that or if you had, like, a really, really rude person behind the counter giving you your order because I have seen them where I work but, only a couple. Most of us are super, super nice. Ugh, I get mad when people are rude behind the counter too because there is no way -- there's no reason for it, really, whatever.

Their age range is from anywhere from twenty seven all the way down to about seventeen. So I'm kind of in the middle, but kind of not. You can actually see two out of three of them - do I collect anything? For now I've been collecting a year's worth of Netflicks envelopes and I've been putting them on my wall. I'm as you can tell, but back in the day I used to collect stamps and comic books of Archie and friends. Now, I don't watch sport very often, but I say when I do, my favorite sport to watch would probably be baseball and as far as favorite sports to play, I usually run track in field in High School and I used to run cross country. So yes, running is a sport. It's freaking hard. That's for sure.Hey, how's it going? Hola. Hello, is this thing on? So hi, how's it going?

"VLOG26","﻿I know it's been a couple of weeks, but I've been really busy and I was just on vacation this last week, so I haven't really had the time. Um, but the other reason is because the past, like, two or three weeks before this week when I went on vacation, I actually wasn't doing that well. Um, which I was really scared to tell anybody because I have not done that in over a year. So, um, I was really ashamed of it, um, and I didn't, you know, do terrible or whatever, um, it's just since I started LA Weight Loss, which has been over a year now, I have not cheated on my diet at all. I have not eaten anything that I shouldn't. Um, and about three weeks ago, I don't know what happened, but, um, I started eating a lot of peanut butter and that basically became my addiction for a couple of weeks. I would come home from work and just kind of eat peanut butter out of the jar and I was -- I would think it's okay, but it wasn't, because I would keep eating it thinking, oh, you know, it's just an extra spoonful here and there, but I would end up eating, you know, a few extra tablespoons every day for like a week straight. Um, so really that was the basis of my like, bad weeks, was eating a lot of peanut butter and then I had one day that I ate too much. I had two extra bowls of cereal, I had an extra dairy, I had, um, I think an extra starch and maybe one more thing, but that might be it, um, and so it's not like I went way over board. I didn't like, you know, stuff myself, I just, um, ate too much that day and I haven't done that in over a year and I'm really ashamed of it, so, um. But I wanted to tell everyone because I'm obviously not perfect and, you know, I think it is okay to have bad days. It's just I haven't had one, so I'm not okay with myself doing that -- I don't allow myself that and, but I'm over it. I'm past it now because, um, this past week I was on vacation and I really wanted to like start again, like, you know, like, no more of that.So I'm on vacation and I had the most amazing time and I got to hang out with XXXX to which I will put his link in the sidebar, um, he's awesome and I had such a blast hanging out with him. Um, I also met XXXX, like, in Arizona, her link in the sidebar as well and ah, love her just as much. Oh my gosh, we had a blast which I will, hopefully -- be soon -- in the next week or two putting up a video of that footage of my vacation, but, um, had a great time and I didn't eat anything that I shouldn't. Um, I had frozen yogurt three times with XXXX, however, um, I didn't eat a lot in that day and we were walking a lot and we hiked and so I think it was completely okay.Um, so, but, ah, yeah -- and so before I left on my vacation I was about one ninety four something. I think on my last weigh in that I posted I was one ninety four point eight and that was about what I was. Um, because the last, you know, few weeks I was just maintaining between one ninety three and one ninety five, so when I left I was one ninety four point eight and, um, this morning when I got home I was one eighty nine which is awesome because, ah, I've never been in the one eighties and I -- it's a really good motivation for me to get right back into gear, and, you know, get this like, I want to be one sixty for my ultimate goal which is only, you know, thirty pounds away. That's not a lot. I can do that and I have new motivation. I have new, um, I feel a strength inside of me to really just do it, um, and that's my plan. So, my plan right now is just do it. I want to do it and, you know, I agree that, you know, it's not like it's a race, I don't have to get it done really fast, but I want to right now. I'm so motivated right now and I don't want it to go away, I just want to focus and do it and be at my goal and simple as that. So that's my new goal for the next, ah, I'm going to give myself, I think, four months -- well not give myself, but am hoping within four months -- at the end of four months I'll have lost, um, about thirty pounds and, ah, I think it's doable. And I have a friend that's gonna, you know, do it with me, so -- 'cause she has basically the exact same amount of weight to lose, so I'm really excited for it. Um, but now I want to tell you about my vacation. How awesome it was.I had an amazing time. I flew to Arizona with my mom -- where my grandparents live -- and I was there for a few days and then, um, after that we went to the Grand Canyon, and then after that we drove up and we went to Yellowstone -- oh, no, actually we went to Arches first , which is really cool and then we went to Yellowstone, and then we drove home. I live in Minnesota, so we kind of went up and to the right whatever, um, it was amazing and I did a great amount of exercise, which I will tell you right now.Right, so the first day I was there, I hiked up a small mountain with my grandpa which was amazing, um, it took him like, I don't know -- I was out hiking for an hour or two, I think like two hours and we had to climb up to the top except there was no path at the top, so we just had to climb up rocks and, you know, be very careful because they were like -- some of them were falling and there's cactuses, so I had to like dodge them and I got my hand poked a few times and it was an amazing feeling hiking up there and climbing down and hiking and just, you know, it was a great exercise.The very next day, the next morning actually at like five thirty in the morning I got up and I went for a twenty mile bike ride with my grandpa and his little community friend which was beautiful, but awesome and great exercise and then within an hour XXXX had picked me up and, um, we went to another mountain to go hike up, which, um -- unbelievable because that one it took us about three hours to do. It took us about two hours to get up to the top and then an hour to get down, approximately. Um, and it was amazing. I didn't think we could do it and we stopped a lot -- well, I had to stop a lot, he has incredible endurance -- I don't know. Telling me to stop a lot and we really should keep going, and we're just like we got to do, so we did it and it was beautiful and I can't believe we did it. We hiked up to the top of a very high mountain and it was amazing and uh, it was great and it was a great workout and, uh, I'm just so proud of myself and XXXX.Um, then the next day we didn't necessarily do like exercise, but we walked a lot. We walked to the grocery store, we walked around his campus, we walked to the mall, like, we did, you know, a decent amount of walking, so that was pretty good.And then the next day I was at the Grand Canyon, and I walked two and a half miles around the rim of the Grand Canyon which was also beautiful. And then the very next day, the next morning I hiked down a mile and a half into the Grand Canyon, which wasn't too difficult, but then I had to hike that mile and a half back up the canyon which was very difficult, very hot, very tough, very steep incline. Wow, very, very hard.Then the very next day we were at Arches and I hiked, I think it was, um, it was about two and a half miles just hiking around different trails, and up and down, you know, hills and what not and arches and getting to arches and what not, and so that was -- that was a good day 'cause it was very hot and it was tiring and I ran a little bit. It was great.Um, and then the next day when we were in Yellowstone. I did a little, little tiny bit of hiking, but not much. It was really cold and I was driving a lot that day, so I don't really count that, but, um, I was very active on vacation and it was amazing and I think that's why I lost about five pounds this vacation. So that was amazing.Um, but yeah, I will hopefully make another video, um, soon about my vacation what not, um, and yeah I -- I really hope that by next week I can hopefully maybe be down to one eighty seven. That's going to be my mini goal. I'm really motivated and I really want to do this, um, and I think I can, so, yeah.Hey everyone, I'm here and I'm finally making an update.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG260","Hey everybody. Thanks for checking out the new video. Sorry it's so late, I had to work last Friday. Usually I don't work Fridays, my company's sweet, we only work Monday through Thursday, but because of Labor Day, I had to work.No time to do a video, but XXXX and I had talked about -- not XXXX, her name's not XXXX -- XXXX -- XXXX and I had talked about doing a collab together way back and she wrote the script, she wrote the shot list, it was her concept, uh, for her XXXX series. We kinda incorporated into the small life -- Living with Lino or Life of Lino sketch in one of my earlier clips, which actually I was inspired by her to do that. I was like, if she can do videos with Barbie and not get sued I can do a video with Lino and not get sued. I just don't know how that random guy does all the things with those toys and somebody hasn't gone, wait a minute. But, uh, this is actually -- people might have already seen this little response, because I tried recording it with YouTube and their upload from a webcam feature and uh, boy, did that not work. So I just turned on the old iMovie and see what happens, but uh. So make sure to check out XXXX's channel, XXXX. She also does the XXXX on XXXX, and she has a twitter account and she does lots of great stuff, so make sure to check her out, if you haven't already, from the XXXX.To everyone who said, my favorite's Chris, when are you going to apply for Partner? And if so, will you then be famous? Um, the answer is no, I won't be famous. The answer -- the other answer is, uh, when I hit three thousand subscribers, which I'm close to, but who knows when it'll happen, if it'll happen. So it might -- people might decide tomorrow that I suck. I can have -- wouldn't surprise me, but once I hit three grand, I'll probably apply for Partnership again to see if YouTube will accept me. Am I as funny as the other Partners, YouTube? Am I? Can I bask in the same glow and as -- I'm not going to name the names, 'cause I don't like most of them. Um -- but, uh, thanks for your support, thanks for watching. Um, stay I'm famous? Thanks a lot, guys, girls, keep watching, subscribe, comment, pay, ya, ya, ya, va, va, va.

"VLOG261","Hi guys. So I put up two singing vlogs like, earlier. Um, Battlefield, by Jordan Sparks, and -- -- Your Raise Me Up, Josh Groban, sorry. So, uh, this is the third one, Signed, Sealed, Delivered. You see me coughing, that's why I'm wearing this. Like a fool I went and stayed too long. Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong, oh, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

"VLOG262","﻿So, this is a quick blog to test out the new auto captions feature. A warning to you all is that it is going to suck a bit because there will be no background noise and I am reading this as a transcript that I can upload later on and see how accurately Google can time code tags to make this text file into a captions file.I am interested in finding out how well it matches the text to what I'm saying. I want to see if it works for accents that aren't American and how it splits up the text. Of course, I also have some questions for the good folk at YouTube.First up, when will machine captioning become available to more users? As someone who uses captions a lot, I would love to get my hands on this feature and I think I can offer some good feedback. So perhaps YouTube could consider users like myself, if they are going to roll it out, for channels.The second thing is, of course, when will these be made available in other languages? Obviously if this feature were to become available in Japanese, that would be a huge help to all the Japanese language students out there. There are several videos explaining this feature here, right here and here. The long one is a bit of a chore, but the explanations seems to indicate that the main audience that they're thinking of is the hearing impaired.This might be followed by more people perhaps interested in translated captions, which is more my area of interest. My more precise area of focus is even more specialized than this. It is making captions for students of language, which is why I make all my captions bilingual. This means I have other features that I want to see, like the ability for people to download caption files to read and study, and the ability to collaboratively make and upload captions to other people's channels. For now, I just want to see how this works, so make sure your captions are turned on below, and see what you think of the syncing. Peace.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG263","Hey everybody, how's it going? It has been quite a while since I have done this, uh, and I'm sorry about that. You know what? I'm actually sorry for you that I keep saying sorry for shit. Umm, seems like anything that I do I take long hiatuses on. I just, my attention span is very, very small, uh, even with things I like. And, speaking of things I like, here, I have a new game plan for Christian's vlog. Um, I just don't seem to have it in me to be, ah, be witty, and have some kind of idea and themes to each different vlog. Um, the ones I did before, you know, they were fun, but I just, that much production going into it -- not that it was Spielberg -- but, you know, transitions, and fancy stuff, I just don't really have the time for anymore, but I still kinda wanna put things out.So, what I was thinking of doing, was sticking to something that I could pretty much turn out pretty quickly. And it doesn't take much work, and I think people will enjoy it. Um, so I'm gonna stick to what I know, and that's music, as you can see. If you can only see this side, it's, uh, music crazy with lots of gear. Anyways, um, so yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna start playing tunes instead of getting drunk and filming it. That was fun, but I've done it, so I don't need to do it again. Umm, so that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take requests -- but here's the catch -- to give me a little bit of control over what I do. Rather than just randomly taking requests, so that I don't get, you know, some ridiculous songs, um, I'm gonna take requests by year. So, people can say, you know, nineteen seventy six, and I have to pick a song from nineteen seventy six to play, or nineteen eighty five, or nineteen thirty two, you know?Obviously the farther back you go it'll get a little more fun for me to try to find something to do. But anyways, that's what I'm gonna do. So, put your requests in, down in the comments. Umm, it's -- I -- I don't think it's gonna be like whoever comments first that's not what I'm gonna do. I think I'll just randomly pick one, um, to give everybody a chance. 'Cause there's people who, and you know who you are, will probably watch this very quickly, like, as soon as I put it out, and there's people who won't see it for a week. So, I want to give everybody a chance to -- that wants to -- to uh, put, uh, Jesus, I'm just losing track of what I'm talking about here. Alright, I'm good. Um, I want everybody to have a chance to put in a request for a year.I'm sure most people start with their birth year, but then once you get past that, you know, it's kinda fun ta -- to you know, hear me do a tune that's from the forties, or you know, something like that. And of course, being me, I'm not just gonna -- I'll probably be doing them acoustic, um, 'cause, you know, there's only one of me. Um, so, it'll be fun. And of course I'm going to do them in my own style, so even if it is from the forties I might, you know, try to do something else with it, but, anyways, that's what I'm doing, that's what this vlog is going to be from now on. Maybe I'll pepper in, you know, some kind of goofy one once in a while, but for now the -- these are the type of vlogs that I can handle doing and putting out, hopefully on a semi regular basis. So, thank you for everyone who has subscribed.Hopefully, um, you won't umsub -- you won't um -- you won't umsubscribe -- you won't unsubscribe just because I'm only doing music now. But uh, at least it's more interactive, everybody likes music, and I will take a stab at different years. So, comment, and thank you for watching, and uh, have a pleasant day, evening, wherever you are, year. Okay, that's it..","Low","High","Low"
"VLOG264","I haven't made a video in forever. Anyway, hello, it's XXXX making a blog on October twentieth, yeah. I don't really have any excuses; I've just been lazy, laziness prevails. Stuff happens. I just don't feel like blogging and when I do find the inspiration to finally blog, the camera isn't charged and then I'm just, like, daaah waaah and then my mom gets home with my sister from whatever they were doing on that Saturday, ugh, annoyance, yeah.Uh, Windows seven comes out in two days and I am going to get a laptop soon and, um, yeah, that's going to be awesome. I also don't think I'm living up to my channel name, it's supposed to be XXXX, and I don't really make random videos. I mean I've made some in the past, where I was, like, just did some random short skit stuff, like that Christmas video thing where I was, like, an evil shocker pen person. I need to make random videos and as soon as my laptop -- as soon as I get one, I will try to instead of just blogging and telling you about my amazing life I will, um, try and do something random and funny and actually live up to my channel name, XXXX.Yes, if you haven't noticed my hair grew a lot. Except it's not what it used to be, it's not long, its' not my beloved emo hair -- emo hair, which I actually use a flat iron on; flat irons aren't gay. And, um, yeah, my friend he's, like, oh XXXX, you're gay, 'cause you use a flat iron, blaah, screw you. And, um, also I've been talking to my new friend about next summer, maybe is -- since -- when it grows back it'll be long and yeah -- and maybe I can kinda put streaks in it or something, but -- because I can't do that at school, because it's a private school and the hair has to be natural color and I want it to be kind of like red streaks and maybe somewhere -- I don't know. Tell me your ideas; I think it will be cool.I'm not really emo. I don't cut myself; see there so clean, emo, it's about the music - it's about the music, people! I also listen to indi, nerdy music, of course, and wizard rock who's amazing. And my friend, my carpool person, she's been asking me to, like, send her all my wizard rock songs and I can't, because email sucks. So, I have to, like, put it on jump drive for her and she's kinda -- she attacks me.It's October, yeah, it's October, so, um, last weekend or this weekend, October seventeenth, was homecoming and I went and I asked this girl. She's nice and it was fun and she didn't really dance much, but I danced with, like, people and it was fun. There was a chocolate fountain, but I only had, like, one chocolate strawberry and that was it. I didn't eat the entire night and I was really sweaty; it was hot and the music was terrible, but I mean you could dance to it; like, you can't really dance to emo music and all that, you know, uh huh. It was fun.Also since it's October, Halloween, it's in, like, two weekends, yeah, so I need a costume. I think I already know what I want to be. I want to be Mario and I will have, like, coveralls and, like, you -- have you seen that music video by Lou Connard with -- he's Mario; I want to be, like, dressed like that, except I don't have hair like his, um, obviously.And the day after that, November 1st, I'm going to a concert, the Maine, Cobra Starship, Boys Like Girls, A Rocket the Moon and similar. I don't really like Boys Like Girls, or I don't really listen to A Rocket to the Moon, but the Maine and Cobra Starship are amazing. I cannot wait to see them. Like, did you see that? I was, like, jumping like out of my seat, like, blaah.School has been okay, I don't really want to talk about school, because I think that's a boring subject to talk about. But, I will talk about choir; it is awesome, and the people are amazing. I'm the bass; I sing deep.In April, I get to go to New Orland's for a week and I get to see wicked for the first time.Um, you know how I was talking about being inspired on that one Saturday, when the camera was being stupid and not charged; well my friend, she goes to a public school which I obviously can't name on YouTube, and, um, she found a nerdfighter. And I desperately wanted to meet this person, because it'll be amazing; and I don't really know any other nerdfighters in my area. And, um, yeah.Uh, she also has a Quidditch team at her school. Argh, I'm jealous. Ah, we need that. If we had a Harry Potter club, that would be amazing; I would join. I would, like, nyah, but I've not even done with the books yet, um, I'm still on the fifth book, God I'm taking forever. Uh huh, that is all I have to say, I believe. Good bye.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG265","Hey guys, it's Saturday, January thirty first and I'm really sick and I'm going to make this brief because moviemaker hasn't been working all week and I have fallen pretty ill, um, I have swollen tonsils and I'm losing my voice anytime I talk too much. My nose is running, I'm coughing and I have a lot of stuff to do this weekend, namely revise papers for a prestigious program I'm trying to complete. Um, do normal homework, work and, um, do chores around the house and so, I'm sorry. I'm going to try and make a better vlog hopefully at my mom's house or at my boyfriend's house, but it's just looking like my computer's sick and I'm sick, which altogether leaves to a horrible project.

"VLOG266","So when I was thinking about videos that I could do for my YouTube page, I was actually considering doing a video about a child that my family and I sponsor in Ethiopia. But then, I went to the XXXX page and they were talking about Project for Awesome, two thousand and eight, and I thought it was a perfect opportunity for me to talk about this charity. The charity I have chosen to talk about is called Compassion. A lot of people are talking about how they're suffering, and because of the economic turmoil that Canada, the U. S. , the whole entire world is going through right now. And even though that is true, we have to take a step back and realize that there are people all around the world who are suffering far mean children, mainly because they really can't do much for themselves.So on their website you can pick a child, deciding on what gender you want, the age, the country they live in, it -- it really doesn't matter, or you can ask for them to send you a random child in the mail that you can sponsor for thirty five dollars a month. Now, that's the Canadian price. I have absolutely no idea what it is in other countries, because they are situated 'round the world, so you would have to go to the specific website for your country to find out how much it is to sponsor a child. The story about how my family actually decided to sponsor a child is pretty interesting. I was in tenth grade, and I went to a concert for a Christian singer I really like, called Rebecca Saint James. And I went with my dad, and we were pretty close, we were like, in the fourth row, or something like that, and she was talking about how her, and her home, and her family, sponsored children through Compassion.And, I don't know, just the way she was describing it and how she actually went over there and got to see how her money and other people's money were being put to good use, it just touched me and I really, like, I couldn't obviously -- I couldn't afford it because I was fifteen at the time -- I just really asked my dad if, um, we could sponsor this child. So she asked the audience to raise your hand if you wanted, like, a little portfolio thingy for a child, and uh, I raised our hand, and we got this child called Senit . Here she is. Also on the sheet, it explains where exactly your money is going. So it says that it helps provide your sponsored child with medical checkups, clothing, recreational activities, tutoring, tuition, and scholastic materials. So I thought that was really great that you know exactly where your money's going, and what is being provided for your child. So you know that he or she is going to be well taken care of.So there we go. I told you a little bit about Compassion, what they do, and, you know, even if you -- if you can't afford to make any sort of donation or even sponsor a child, maybe you know somebody who can, and -- or you can try and raise awareness about it, too. Now, I really want the thumbnail to show up for -- so I'm going to just have the next a minute -- a minute to two minutes -- of the thumbnail in hopes that it'll let me pick it, so, the video's ending now. Thank you for listening.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG267","Hey, YouTube or just like the couple of people who watch me on this. But that's cool too. Hey guys. Um, I was tagged for this, um, Harry Potter survey in like October two thousand and eight and I did not do it and I have not done it and now I am doing it now.Okay, and there's gonna be rapid fire and there's gonna be crazy and spastastic because I am going to try and do it all in one take. And as you guys know, I cannot edit because if anybody out there knows, what editing system works with the Coolpix? Nikon Coolpix P Four BR -- I dunno what all those things mean but Coolpix in this is not the reason I'm posting this. I'm posting this because I want to talk about Harry Potter 'cause who doesn't wanna do that.So I've got my list of questions and I've got some Post it notes and some crayons, so let's get down to business, shall we?Okay, let's do this. Um, let's just -- fair warning right now. I am probably going to start every question with, why are you making me answer this question because it is physically and mentally and emotionally impossible.Okay, number one. What is your favorite wizard rock band?Why are you making me answer this question? Um, it really depends on my mood. Um, uh, if I -- if I really wanna dance or something, I'll listen to Ministry of Magic. Um, the Parcelmouths. Um, pretty much those guys. I just love dancing to their music and -- but if I'm feeling really, really fan girly and really romantic kind of mood, I'll listen to Mudbloods or I'll listen to Roon -- Roonil Wazlib. La la. I cannot speak because I'm trying to do this really fast. Um, Neville's Diary. I want to give a shout out to him because I think he is adorable and, yeah, that's all I can think of right off the top of my head.Next question. Doodle yoo. How did you get into wizard rock, which is number two?I got into wizard rock, uh, I think in my junior year of high school. I'm a senior. That's right, it's at the end of senior year and -- or before that, I'm not exactly sure but my friend Margaret and I -- she really is the one that got me into it. She said, have you heard of Harry and the Potters? So I said, no who are these? They're -- they sound amazing because they have to do with Harry Potter. And she showed me their MySpace and I got really excited and then I clicked on his friends and then their friends and then their friends and then, Team Hoyt and I just kind of swapped notes on who was cool and then it just kind of rolled into this big ball of awesome wizard rock and it -- so happy it happened. Thank you, Team Hoyt, for showing me Harry and the Potters because it never would've gotten as awesome as it is now. Okay. Yeah.Number three, have you ever been to a wizard rock concert?Yeah. I have. I've only been to one. I'm lame and -- but, I mean at least I've gone to one. Right? Right. And I have their signature. My Post it is folding. Um, it had the Whomping Willows, and, uh, Symatma Jockmill and then , uh, Justin Flinch Fletchley and the Sugar Quills and, uh, Catchlove. So I have all their signatures on the back of a shirt, but since I'm being really quick and random with this video, I won't move from this spot 'cause I don't want this to be over five minutes and if it is, I am very sorry about that.Wizard rock concerts are super fun and I need to go to more before I die. Okay. Most played wizard rock song on your iPod. I think it was Save Ginny Weasley. I've listened to that one a lot. Probably because it's the first wizard rock song I've ever heard. Uh, that was a really good song by Harry and the Potters. Um, I think a close second was, uh, Accio Love by Ministry Magic.Number five, if you had a wizard rock band, what would it be called?Yes. Um, I decided -- 'cause I have made a wizard rock song, but it was really more like the mournings of -- mourning of being a muggle and how much it sucks being a muggle when it -- like, it does if you knew about the wizarding world. Kinda like, Petunia did. But from my point of view and how I wish I could operate and how I wish that I could have a spell check quill before it goes bad and starts making Ronald Weasley come out Roonil Wazlid. Um, anyways, I would've called it, uh, uh, Faith, Trust and Nargle. Like faith, trust in pixie dust, isn't that what Tinkerbell says? But then end it with the Nargles which I don't know if that's stupid or clever. Ha ha. You make up your mind. Put it in the comment side.Six, I think I'm on six. Are you a nerd fighter?Yes. I am a nerd fighter. Ooh ah. That was a quick one.Um, when did you get into Wizard rock?I think I already answered that. Um, junior year. Pretty sure, junior year. XXXX, correct me if I'm wrong. But I think you got into it just a little bit before me because you were pretty quick on the draw. Share it with me, I think. Hmm.Eight, what is your favorite rock song?Um, oh gosh, why are you making me choose? Today my favorite rock song is, um, I dunno know, uh, long dramatic pause, Wizard Rock Heart Throb. I will go with that because I like dancing to that.Uh, nine, um, favorite Harry and the Potters song?I really like These Days are Dark. Even though it, like -- it's really long and it's one of their longer ones. I could say it's one of their longest songs. I just -- I love it and it's really upbeat and it just makes me get butterflies inside and makes me extremely happy. Just like penguins on my cheeks. Yes. Okay.Current favorite song/band -- I dunno where to put this.Um, current favorite song/band? My current favorite band is, hm, probably the Mudbloods and my current favorite song from them -- I'm just gonna pick from them, is, um, Be my Witcher. Yeah. That song. It's so cute and it's so upbeat and I just love rocking out to it and, um, rock with a W. And -- and sexual innuendos and, yes. Great stuff right there.Eleven, greatest lo -- line from a rock song?Mm, I really like Insufferable know it all, Hermione Granger because that's -- that's a lot of syllables to fit into one line and to make it work. Good job, Gred and Forge. You guys are awesome. That's what I'm going to pick right now.Um, favorite dance song?Probably Here in your Car, by the Ministry of Magic because, um, XXXX and I have, like, dance moves to it and, uh, it's really upbeat.Uh, okay. Favorite song to sing along to?Where is this going to go? Oh my gosh, right there. I don't know if you can see my eyes or if that's important or if this will stay. Favorite song to sing along to. Oh my gosh. I think I'm getting a call. Ignore that because I'm covered in penguin. Um, my favorite song to sing along to. Oh, uh, I Heart Weasleys by the Ministry of Magic. This is just like the Ministry of Magic fan girl time isn't it?Um, and favorite ship song?I'm gonna just co -- um, I'm just going to totally, um, pull one out of the hat here because I just think it's so cute. It's, uh, by the Owl Post and it's, uh, Different Kind of Magic. It's about Lily and James and it's so cute and it makes me so happy and, uh, it's great. Also, there's one from Neville's Diary that is just kind of a funny one that is him and, um, Madame Pomfrey -- no Madame Sprout. Oh gosh, Pomona Sprout? Yeah, so Madame Sprout. Why Madame Pomfrey? Uh, okay.So anyways those are my lovely answers to the wizard rock survey. I hope this is quick, I hope it was entertaining and -- oh my gosh, I would walk five hundred miles and I would walk five hundred more.","High","High","Low"

"VLOG269","Who in their right mind actually uses these things? Hey. Argh! I have just filmed seven minutes worth of me talking, and it has just disappeared off the face of the earth. I'm not happy. I'm not happy whatsoever, but I do have something still to talk about now. Yeah! Firstly, um, I'm trying to make it sound like I have many things to say, but I really don't. To start with, it's about the same thing. Um, right.So, last video, I suggested that I could use some of your suggestions for my next video. Um, to be honest, they weren't that impressive. Uh, the best one was from Paul . Uh, he said I should interview my band, uh, which I will do when I'm with them sometime soon. I'm only with them once a week, um, so I'm not too sure when. But it will happen; I promise.If it sees this , um, it's my sister's, but I only put it on um, to cover up my greasy bad hair, which you can see is bad already. Ew, Hob Nobs. They look fresh. Okay. Ooh. But this whole interview thing could be a good idea to get famous. You never know.Gibo nineteen eighty eight uh, he -- is he still on YouTube? I haven't looked. I guess to me, but he -- he used to make um, interviews where the You tube is, and it was good. He think he got kind of a lot of fans out of that.I -- I came across someone I used to subscribe to on my old channel um, XXXX. He was a presenter on the children's BBC in the past, and then he's come all under great internet things. Uh, he's on uh, a channel called Mr. Holy Moly and pocket TV show, and he's quite published; he's quite famous. I -- I like him; I want to be him.He met Mr. T randomly and got to interview Mr. T. I want to do that one day. He would probably be dead by that time, but I still want to do it, just the grave Mr. T. So, um, how's the A Team? Really? Good.And Skype is jumping up and down at me, but I'm not going to click it because the last time I went off this recording thing on iMovie, it went off. So you have to wait for me, someone, whoever it is.Here's another thing. Um, last video was a bit bad because I did it on iMovie HD and the settings I used for it didn't save. So I had to readjust them, but I didn't do it properly. So it kind of changed some of the settings, but the rest didn't connect with that one, so it's all out of tune with each other. So it's all pixeley and the quality was not that good. Hopefully iMovie zero nine will do this better -- hopefully.On bass, I'm trying to learn all the frets uh, from what notes to play so I can adjust to new songs and automatically know what chords to play at what bit and where it is on the fret board, but it does take some time. For example, there's no such thing as an E sharp; it goes E, F. Um, I wasn't kind of aware of that at the time, so I was like, what? What's with the gun ? Or a B sharp, either. What?Yeah, we're writing some more originals when we meet up. We've got two so far. Uh, hopefully we can get three by the end of the week. As usual, I'll keep you updated. Right.I'm going to go now because I think I've -- I've done an adequate amount of footage to whittle down into a smaller internet screen where you can see me and uh, it's been eight minutes, so it's going to take a while to edit, but I'll do it anyway.I -- I'll see you in two days.","High","Low","Low"

So, here it goes. Doesn't look too bad, so far. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. What do you think? Say so on the comments.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG270","We're going to deal with the subject of Islam. Uh, it has come to my attention that obviously you have a wide range of understanding of the key apologetic issues amongst the Muslim People. Some have little to no understanding at all and -- and some are a little more read. Uh, but when it comes to popular Islam, it seems that the most popular name today is Zakir Naik.Now, he of course as we have demonstrated in previous videos, is pretty much just continuing, ah, the work of Ahmed Deedat. His arguments are sometimes word for word identical to Ahmed Deedat and what concerns me is I don't see a lot of evidence that Doctor Naik has gone beyond Ahmed Deedat. Um, especially, in the fact, that, well many people have demonstrated that Ahmed Deedat made many fundamental, basic errors that really, um, for a serious Christian, make his apologetics, um, well, significantly less than compelling, shall we say, might be the nicest way to put it. Uh, bogus would be the more modern way of putting it.Uh, we have documented many of uh, Ahmed Deedat's errors in the past on this YouTube channel. Um, but Dr. Zakir Naik continues to use the same type of argumentation and basically goes like this. You say Jesus never said, I am God, worship me. Um, then you run through an entire list of out of context verses and you do it really, really fast, so that you are really impressing, um, the Muslim audience, but not the Christian audience that actually knows their Scriptures.Now if you're talking to a Christian that doesn't know their bible, they can be totally blown away by someone who can just pull verses very, very quickly. Of course anybody can do that with a Koran too and I suppose in that way, uh, impress Muslims who don't know their Scriptures very well.But from a Christian perspective, that wouldn't be an appropriate thing to do. That would not honor Allah, the truth, would it? Because that's sort of, what politicians do, not what people who are dealing with God's truth do.And so, I was directed recently to the appearance of Zakir Naik on the Deen Show . Now we have interacted with the Deen Show before, I realized when I was starting to look at this that I never finished one series I was doing when I was going through the top ten reasons why Jesus isn't God. It's amazing how much time, uh, the Deen Show spends on, well, attacking Christianity. Um, rather than other things, but maybe that's just because that's what I'm directed to. You know, I could -- that could be a possibility. Um, I -- I will leave that out there, that's something that is a possibility, but they do, do it a lot and in this clip, this session with Zakir Naik first thing they go for is that particular subject.But in the process Dr. Zakir Naik once again demonstrates that neither he nor Ahmed Deedat actually understand the doctrines of trinity. Uh, they do not understand the presentation of the doctrine, they do not understand historically, they do not understand it biblically.And if Zakir Naik is the best known Islamic apologist, what does that say? Shouldn't the best known Islamic apologist at least be accurate in his statements concerning the doctrine of the trinity? Wouldn't just simple truth and honesty and even just respect require that?I -- I think it would, so we're going to look at what Zakir Naik had to say and provide a response and, um, once again I would love to see someone arrange an opportunity to debate Zakir Naik. Um, maybe over more than one night because there are some very important topics to address and it would be very useful, I think, to find out can this man actually go beyond the speed reading of verses and actually deal with the text as it was originally written against someone who knows that text well?That's what I would like to find out. I would be honored to have that opportunity of defending the gospel of Jesus Christ in that context. We would be very happy to see that happen.So let's take a look at, um, Zakir Naik. We start, uh, with the host of the program, seems like a really nice guy, Eddie , um, wouldn't want to mess with him, seems like a pretty big guy, guess he's into martial arts and stuff like that. Um, but he -- notice his description of Zakir Naik as the Doctor of Dawa . I'm not just the one saying here is the big man, this -- this should be the most accurate presentation that we find that's what the Muslims themselves are saying. Let's take a look at it.By popular demand, people have been requesting, people have been asking why don't you have this man on the show. And you know what? Today he's here, the true Doctor AbDawa , Doctor Zakir Naik, when we come back. You don't want .I mean yes, so we're going to get straight to the topic. There's some confusion out there. People are worshiping the sun. They're worshiping the moon. They're worshiping a man. So in this particular show, because you're expert on this topic, we want to give the top reasons why the creator of the heavens and the earth, God almighty, in Arabic we say, Allah, is not a man, never was a man, never tried to be a man.If you analyze, uh, all the major religion of the world except for Islam, all the other major religions of the world they believe that almighty God became a human being once or a number of times. Yes, all the major religions except Islam they believe that almighty God, either once or many times became a human being. And they believe in a philosophy knows as Anthropomorphism.Uh huh.Anthropomorphism means that almighty God taking forms and he becomes a human being and then we ask them why does almighty God have to become a human being? So they say that almighty God he's so holy, he's so pure, he's so noble, he does not know the shortcomings of the human being.Uh huh.He does not know how they make me feel when he's hurt, when he's angry, when it requires certain things. He doesn't know the requirements of the human being, how do they feel, et cetera. That's the reason almighty God came into this world and became a human being to know what is good or what is bad for the human being.Uh huh.On the face of it, it sounds to be a very good logic, oh almighty God, so holy, so pure, so noble, does not know the shortcomings of the human being, does not know how human being feels when he is hurt, when he has problems, so it sounds to be good.Yeah.And I tell them that suppose I had been to manufacture a DVD player.Yeah.I created a DVD player, but because I'm a manufacturer for DVD player, do I have to become a DVD player to know what is good or what is bad for the DVD player. How is it? Because I am the manufacturer, I'm the creator I don't have to become a DVD player, what do I do? I write the instruction manual.Exactly.But if you want to play the DVD inside the DVD and then press the play button.Yes.If you want to skip, press the skip button, if you want to stop, press the stop button. I don't have to become a DVD player to know what is good or the bad for the DVD player, because I am the creator. Similarly, almighty God he is the creator of the human being, so he does not have to become a human being to know what is good or the bad for the human being. What does he do? He chooses a man amongst men and he communicates with them on a higher level, who we call a messenger . He doesn't have to come himself and the last and final message, the last and final instruction manual for the man is the Koran.Now this wasn't really the central aspect of my concerns about what Doctor Naik says. Uh, however, I've never argued that the incarnation is based upon God needing to know what it's like to be a man. Um, that's not a biblical presentation.The necessity of the incarnation really has to do with God's decree and with the means by which forgiveness of sins is provided and that is through the sacrifice of Christ and the union of God's people with Christ. Those are all important things, but it's not God needed to know what it's like to be a man, that's just not a biblical presentation. And so I have to wonder who it is that Eddie is talking about or that Zakir Naik is talking about when he talks about people, uh, saying these things that, uh, well God needed to become a man so he could know what it's like to be a man. Um, that's just simply not a Christian perspective.Uh, at this point then Doctor Naik goes into his how many completely out of context verses can I fire off at you, very, very quickly so as to impress your routine and so we're going to listen to this. So you can get the effect, you can understand, you know, um, why someone who is ignorant of the Bible might find this to be very, uh, impressive or weighty. Uh, but then look at the text and see that Doctor Naik is not dealing with the bible in any kind of serious fashion, uh, but is just giving, uh -- uh -- uh, a standard form of -- of argumentation.now tell us, now it's known commonly that people take Wanda is beloved to our hearts, when we love him as one of the mightiest messengers of God the many are claiming that he said he was God, that he's -","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG271","﻿Okay, this is part two of my anarchy Q and A session. XXXX says I vote for capitalism, which, like democracy, is a horribly flawed system that happens to be the best thing we can come up with at the moment. However, even capitalism is starting to show its flaws like the social ones. I seriously doubt capitalism will survive another fifty years at current rates of technological development. We're perilously close to technologies capable of surpassing the abilities with respect to the specific jobs of most of the morons in our population. . My response, capitalism is nothing more than the non interference of the government in the market, and that transactions within a market should be voluntary.How is capitalism showing its flaws? As far as I can discern, the market trash -- the market crash was -- the market trash -- er, the market crash was triggered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were both government, er, started initiatives. They were private at the time, but the government took them -- told them to give loans to people who could not afford to have houses in the first place. The government told them that, uh, they would have their back in anything went wrong, and look at -- look at them, look at where we are now. Erm -XXXX says, I assume jobs similar to phone tech support, cellphone operators, drive thru restaurant workers, will be among the first to go. As more and more people are displaced, even more pronounced socialist welfare estate will likely spring up, take care for the masses and morons that are literally surpassed intellectually by the machines. Thankfully, this imposes no burden at all on the society as most of the jobs necessary to provide basic resources for this displaced part of the workforce, will also be replaced by machines. Erm, yeah, I guess that's sort of a complicated problem, you know. As a philosopher, I am thinking of dealing -- of ways to deal with the economy post singularity, but that's, that's not really the current issue, right now. I believe that if machines did everything, the world would be like Utopia, we wouldn't have to worry about food and work, and we could just do whatever we wanted. I mean, that sounds great, doesn't it? Unless there's some sort of dark side, but that -- that's kind of a different problem.Anyways, XXXX says, but, hey, reduced government right now would be good, along with fewer laws against things that are nobody's business -- unless government meddling is business.Hey, even though capitalism is going to drive itself in the ground eventually, that doesn't mean it's not the right thing now. Erm, I'm saying, my response is, why reduce the government when you say that freedom causes disaster, or are you saying it didn't?Okay. I'm just gonna answer a few comments now. Nodayde wrote, I love the way statist assumes that it's up to you to give up your home and life you've built for yourself if you object to government extortion and thuggery. Um, Isaac Fineman -- Fineman wrote, erm, you mean the home and life you built amongst the living held of statist tyrant tyranny? And here I thought you saw statism as a real problem, but apparently you don't see it as a bad enough to even warrant moving to escape it. When one contrasts your attitude with those of people who've lived in real statist societies, like Nazi Germany and Soviet Union -- who risked their lives to leave -- I think we got a sense of the degree to which we should take your views seriously.I wrote, let's say, for example, you've lived in a place for a long time, a nice neighborhood, and you've built a house and generated wealth and a life for yourself. Then a group of thugs came into your neighborhood, and demanded money for protection, and forced you to pay for it at gunpoint. Do you feel you should be the one who has to leave? This group of thugs doesn't disrupt your life too much, they just come by weekly to demand protection money to protect you from another, worse, gang two miles away, who would rather, otherwise, charge more protection money. How is that -- how -- how does -- how's wanting to stay in the same place legitimizing this sort of behavior?Anyways, got another comment from Sorianer . Practicality is abandoned for a higher moral, intellectual ideal, or a more specifically, your higher moral ideal. So I'm being asked to abandon potential comfort for your morals? Uh, something said, no, I'm asking you to stop legitimizing the use of force against people for acceptance of it, is what gives it power. And make sure you vote -- sarcasm.Sorianer says, if absolutely no use of force against people is legitimate, then there's no way to address people that act to counter society. Now, just as a clarification, an anarchist is against the initiation force, so we have no problem with, you know, obtaining property that was stolen from us, because that's sort of self defense. Initiation of the force is the problem, starting, you know -- starting aggression on someone is a problem, that's what we have a problem with, and it's not just force, it's the initiation of force, anyways.Louden Theogen says the States is immoral. Crazypants eighty eight says, the state is funded through taxes, which is extracted with a death threat. What I mean is that if you wouldn't pay your taxes, you would be imprisoned, if you fight back you'd be killed. Anarchism one o one.I'm going to explain the concept of monopoly. Monopoly is when a company is allowed, by law, to force everyone to pay for their particular service. Microsoft is not a monopoly. Coca Cola is not a monopoly because they do not own one hundred percent of their sector in the market and they cannot force you to pay for their particular services. The only organization that has a monopoly is the government, because the government has the power, and apparently the right, to force you to pay for their particular services. You do not get to choose who you pay for to pave the roads, to pay for your -- or to provide hydro, protection, et cetera et cetera. You have to pay it. It's mandatory to pay for this particular service, and that's what a monopoly is. And that's why monopolies are bad, because if you are forced to pay for a particular service, whether or not it's good, there's no incentive to provide a good service, 'cause you are paying it anyways, regardless of how shitty it is and that's why government services are shitty.says, if you want so bad to defend anarchists, suggest that you explain in detail how you do better than the police to fight organized crime. Then how you do better than the army to deal with threatening and strong states, or you can just blame sceptics for thinking that mafias, terrorists, and selfishness still exist under the wonderful ideal society that is anarchy?My response, does the police fight crime, or cause crime? In the US, one in a hundred people are imprisoned, and many of them are imprisoned for a victimless crime of drug possession. I see the police as committing the crime here, unjustly incarcerating and brutalizing thousands upon thousands for drug possession. Who owns your body? Do you, or does the government own your body? If you believe in self ownership, then you believe that you have the right to consume what foods you want, even if they are in an -- unhealthy. You have the right to get tattoos, even if other people find them distasteful, and he has a right to do drugs, because the only person being affected, when you smoke a joint, is you. Furthermore, the reason -- the reason gangs and crime syndicates exist is because certain things people want are illegal, such as drugs.There is a market for drugs. This is why there's people, you know -- they exist the black market to provide it. For example, in Prohibition the mafia gang, er, gained enormous strength and affluence by smuggling the alcohol, and gangs ran entire cities and ran rampant in society. Alcohol is a drug, when they relegalized it -- alcohol again, these gangs lost much of their power. We don't see Budweiser and Molson -- Canadians -- shooting it out in the streets over territory. And the gang violence over drugs will cease, if drugs were -- were -- were just legalized.Also, the police don't defend citizens against crime. They rarely catch a criminal before they commit a crime, or even right after they commit a crime. Uh, the best way to -- to be defended, is to defend yourself. The police usually just swings by and picks up the bodies after the fact.Also, to deal with strong states, you can have a voluntary militia, I mean, Switzerland does it fine. I'll just read an article: at any given moment forty three hundred stationary sirens sound off in Switzerland indicating a foreign invasion and a nuclear holocaust. Within twelve hours, a militia of six hundred thousand Swiss men enrolled in, either , in aged between eighteen and forty grabbed their storm wear, M fifty seven semi automatic assault rifles and army fatigue from the closets and storm out of their apartments and chalets into the front line to protect their homeland. The Swiss army is civilian, not professional, which impressed Adolf Hitler during World War Two. In a nineteen forty -","Low","Low","High"

"VLOG274","﻿I feel like it's been forever! I've been really busy since -- actually I don't really know when. Busy -- actually -- okay, I'm not busy -- I -- I just -- I don't know, like, every time it gets to be, like, winter and stuff, like, I go insane, like, I just -- I, um. Oh yeah, so the Halloween party that I went to was really fun the guys planned this haunted house scavenger hunting for the girls. Yeah, it was quite an experience I would say. But we didn't, like, carve pumpkins or anything. We were supposed to but what happened was the night before Halloween we went to the grocery store to buy stuff and then we couldn't find any more that sold pumpkins after, like, one o'clock in the morning so we decided to, um -- I know this is bad. I don't know if I, like, I'm gonna get in trouble for, like, saying this but we went driving through the neighborhood and we actually borrowed, um, people's pumpkins. So by the end of the night we got, like, fifty pumpkins and, um, to people who live around my neighborhood, I'm sorry. I mean if you're gonna freaking, like, put pumpkins on your front porch then who -- like, who's not gonna steal them -- you know? Like, so I'll post the pictures, um -- I mean it's not that you wanna see them anyway but I really don't care what you guys think. I'm kidding. I think my hair's growing. I hate having short hair like this. It's so annoying, like, yeah, it's fun for, like, the first month but after that, like, the whole growing process is just boring.

"VLOG275","﻿The bar I'm gonna talk about today is Train Bar. Um, also called Mistral Bleu. Um, it's -- it's in Roppongi. Um, basically to get there from Roppongi Crossing is you walk down towards -- depending on the side of the street you walk on, you walk down towards either McDonalds or Donki Hordo . Um, basically, it's right at McDonalds, then there's a tiny little street and then you're -- if you cross that tiny little street, uh, you see some stairs going down and Train Bar is -- is in the wall right next to those stairs. Uh, that sounds maybe a little difficult but it's -- it is quite easy to find. Ask anyone for, uh, um, yeah, uh where McDonalds is and, uh, you should pretty much see it.Um, Train Bar is a rock bar. Uh, it's really tiny. It's one of the -- I think it's the only rock bar really in, uh, in Roppongi -- at least I haven't found any else. And, uh, I haven't heard about any else and generally, there's not that many up in Tokyo. Um, so they only play rock music. Uh, heavy rock, metal, um, some kind of -- some -- sometimes the old rock. Basically, anything in the rock genre. Um, it's -- it's very small, uh, but can get very busy. Um, in general, the crowd is a little bit older. Uh, I'd say in general, people are plus thirty. Not saying young people don't go in. They do, but they definitely don't make out the majority. As also, in general -- I'm speaking in very general terms here -- in general, the crowd is more men than women. Um, and I think both fit, just because, you know, uh, old style rock music -- so it has an older crowd. Uh, and in general -- in my experience at least, uh, rock music, especially the older kind, was more of a guy thing than a girl thing, in very, very general terms. Uh, so that might explain it.Uh, ironically, it's a rock bar but you find a lot of high end people there. Uh, usually people with, uh, with quite good jobs and even people taking out business partners for a drink in the night and stuff like that. I definitely made some -- some very good contacts there. Um, fights pretty much never happens. Uh, I've heard about them one or two times, never seen them and I go there a lot. Uh, I'd say, you know, it's a once in a full moon, uh, kinda thing. It'll happen, maybe a small fight every year, you know, maybe a couple of times every year or something like that.Uh, the crowd are usually very cool, very friendly. It's definitely a meet people kind of spot. People are very easy to talk to. Um, the only -- the -- one of the down sides is though that since it's so tiny, it only takes one person to fuck it up for everyone else. If one person is being a loud idiot who runs around doing stupid shit and is generally very annoying, you can't really move away from him, you know, even if you go down to the other end of the bar. He's still very, very much, you know, doing stuff to your experience, so that's perhaps one of the only downsides. Um, when it gets crowded and when not -- I can't say when. Of course, in general on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday are more crowded than, um, the other days.When it's open? It's usually open every day, sometimes Sundays closed. And, um, of course on special holidays and stuff like that. It usually opens around, uh, five or six in the -- uh, six or seven in the evening, roughly. Again, but that also depends. It's pretty much when the owner or whoever works on that day decides they want to open. Staff -- very, very cool people, by the way. Um, you will find a healthy mix of both Japanese and, um, foreigners. Uh, sometimes more foreigners, sometimes more Japanese. I'd say it's roughly fifty fifty.Um, the prices is fairly cheap compared to places in Roppongi. It's definitely one of the cheaper places in Roppongi. Uh, beer and such start at seven hundred yen and pretty much nothing goes over a thousand yen. Uh, the only prices that go over a thousand yen are things like a bottle of red wine or champagne, things like that. Uh, but in general, they're pretty cheap. Uh, from five to nine thirty is happy hour. Or is it eight thirty? Now, nine thirty, I'm pretty sure. Um, or is it just nine? Anyway you get the general -- nine ish, uh, it's happy hour which means, uh, all drinks are five hundred yen, which is super cheap, uh, in Roppongi. So that's definitely a good spot to warm up. Uh, they also, um, they have a bell that you can ring. If you ring it, you buy shots for everyone at the bar. Usually, I would not recommend doing that if it's a full night. Um, shots are usually around eight hundred yen, by the way.Um, they have a very healthy music selection and feel free to request songs. Go over and browse through their -- they have pretty much huge wall section uh for -- for CDs. You can also bring in your own CDs and stuff like that, as long as obviously the music kind of fits. Uh, you won't hear any Britney Spears, I'm sorry. Um, the -- the bar has a very long history. Uh, it's pretty much always been in the same family. The owner's Indian. His name's Roy -- very cool guy. Um, and it's been his -- been in his family from the beginning. I think it's around thirty years now and have been visited by a lot of rock bands, rock crews and stuff like that after concerts and stuff like that, which is a very nice to happen.Um, they definitely have a lot of regulars. Oh, I'd say regulars make up eighty percent of the people that are usually there. There's not that many tourists because it's -- it's usually not in tourists -- uh, it's usually not in tourist books. Uh, it has been a couple of times though, but in general is not. Uh, which is a shame, it's really cool. Um, yeah, so, uh, but I definitely -- you know, should I rank it? Should I rank it from -- um, on a -- on a one to ten? Depending on what you're in the mood for, you know, it would be perfect. Other times, it's just not. Um, I don't want to give anything a ten so I'd -- I'd give it an eight or nine, you know. Pretty -- pretty damn good. I recommend it if, uh, if you like rock music. If you don't, then it might not be so much your place. Anyway, um, so if you're in Roppongi, check out Train Bar. It's a cool place.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG276","Hey, YouTube. Um, I have been thinking a lot about relationships and relations with different people. Um, I learned a lot this summer and recently about -- mostly about, like, how different people create different relationships and how multiple different people can cause relationships to end weird or be weird. I don't know -- I -- I struggle with different kinds of relationships, personally, ah, because of the way I grew up, but that's not always the case, and I'm not, like, using it as an excuse. It's more like family relationships. I'm just talking about, like, friends. Um, I made a mistake this summer and at that point in time it was like the best thing I thought to do, and what I felt was right, and maybe there was too much emotion going on, ah, for me personally. Uh, it's -- it's --it's like a -- like a weird, tricky balance that you -- is hard to -- to deal with sometimes.I don't really, I don't know. I struggle with relationships every day of my life. It's 'cause they take work, and I -- it takes a lot of guts and a lot of want to fix something after you broke it, intentionally, unintentionally, whatever. Um, 'cause sometimes people make mistakes and they're not quite sure why, and they didn't -- or they didn't think it was a mistake at the time. Um, like my brother called me yesterday and it sounded like he wanted a different -- I have an older brother who I have negative and positive emotions towards -- and he sounded like he wanted to, um, like, build a relationship again, I guess, or, like, he needed something from me. He wanted something from me, but I didn't really feel like I needed to give that to him. 'Cause I wasn't sure it was, and I don't really have very many emotions for him I guess, now.And maybe I'm not ready, uh, and so even when it comes to friends, I -- I learned a lot about what kind of friends I want, and what kinds I need, and what kinds I don't, uh, and, I'm not opposed to owning up to my mistakes -- that's not the issue -- it's more like -- I don't know, just not getting other people to understand mistakes, and, like, being able to explain where you were coming from and -- 'cause to me -- to emotions get wrapped up in it. Uh, I don't know, it's hard. It's, like, you don't know how much effort you should put forth for a relationship of any kind. Um, most -- most right now I'm talking about friendships, because I -- I had a group of friends this summer that I did something that I didn't view as necessarily wrong, and it just started to get disbanded, and then apparently I got distant.I mean what really happened is; I just started spending more time with other people, or I was working full time; I mean, that's the other thing that happened. I don't know. I just get super confused. And it -- it does take a lot of guts just to, you know, call someone up and be like, yes, what I did wrong. Um, and then you have to weigh out if that's really necessary, but I mean honestly I guess another good way to think about something, or anything in life is, what do you really have to lose? Usually, you don't have anything to lose because you've already lost it, or you never had it before in the beginning anyway. But, it's just sort of, like, having enough courage to -- I don't know -- um, go about that and actually go and do it, is the hardest part, and that's kind of what I'm trying to figure out now.It's like, who's -- who's most of my relationships, actually? It's like, what is the pro and con of -- of me, you know, putting myself out there, and like, trying this. Because, more often than not, it's not going to be the -- the outcome that I want. And, like, I do miss people, and I may have messed up, but it's, like, I make one mistake and -- and to them it might have been huge -- and I'm sorry about that, but it's just, like, I made one mistake and it's like everything was poked through -- it gets thrown out the window. And, like, an example of me not forgiving someone, or me not really wanting to build a relationship anymore with my parents, because kind of just the way that all went down, it's much bigger than one mistake it's, you know, fourteen years mistakes, it's a long time.And my brother thinks I need to speak to -- it's just all -- all these relationship issues seem to be coming up, and I -- I'm not the relationship expert, obviously, I -- I -- I kind of fail. But, I do try. I'm only nineteen, it's not like I'm spectacular at life right now. I don't know. So, it's just, like, trying to weight out pros and cons, and trying to figure out who, uh, is going to be most beneficial. That is my update for now. I will update, uh, more often, hopefully, and I hope everyone is doing well.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG277","Hey YouTube. Before I started, I just wanted to say thank you for continuing to watch my videos and for subscribing and everything like that. I just logged on today and I just saw the amount of subscribers I had. In the big picture, it's not that much, but I mean, it's just so cool that you guys are actually interested.I know there's so many like, funny, stupid, brainless sort of videos on the internet. You click on them and you watch them. And that's cool, I'm guilty of it too. Failblog all the way. But you know, I wanna try and do something different with this channel. You know, I want to sorta encourage like, thinking and shared creativity and inspire and just make people think, you know.And I know a lot of people aren't really up for that and I know, the internet, it's a great way to do that. But the quantity of those kinds of videos and the popularity of those obviously aren't as big of some of the other more comedic, uh, stupid videos out there. You know, so to see that many people interested in my videos is really amazing, so thank you so much for that. Really.All right, sorry for that bit of a tangent there. Man, man, I just sorta wanted to talk -- I haven't actually done one of these in a long time. I've just been so busy, it feels kinda strange to talk to my computer again.I just want to talk a bit about like, dreams and goals. You know, we all have 'em. We all want to do things in our life and get certain places in our life and accomplish certain things. I -- I mean, I have a lot of goals. I have a lot of big dreams, but sometimes it just gets to a point where, you know, it scares me almost every single day, to think that I might not achieve them. You know, might not get to where I want to be or, you know, things just won't work out the way I hope they -- hope they -- hope they woo -- clearly I haven't done this in a long time. Hope they do, so it's good to be determined.I am definitely very determined and I have a lot of things on my to do list. I am going to do that. I'm determined to follow through on these ambitions and you know, do what I want to do in my life and be happy and content. And that determination, you know, comforts me.But at the same time, I'm getting to a point where, it's, you know if I, if I don't quite get to where I want to be, how I feel that I won't be fulfilled. You know, that I won't be satisfied.And it's scary. It's like someone wanting to dig a hole to Japan, you know, the old myth that you could just dig a hole through the earth to get to the other side, China or Japan. And I'm digging that hole and I'm going down there and I'm getting there, but at the same time I look back and I'm so deep that there's no way out of it, you know. I'm on this route and I have these dreams and I have to get there. But at the same time, it's scary because I know that if I don't get there, I'm going to be stuck in this hole.It's -- I don't know, basically I'm rambling, gosh. I just was wondering. You know? I'm sure many of you have dreams and ambitions or had some and you've achieved them, maybe accomplished them, maybe are still working on them. What do you do to sort of comfort yourself in hopes of achieving them, you know? How do you, you know, tell yourself that you know, everything's going to be okay; things will work out the way they're supposed to work out?Because to me, just saying that is not enough. You know, I have these dreams. I want to do some big things in my life. You know, I want to get into film and I want to, you know, I wanna make movies; I want to write movies; I want to act in movies. I want to do all those things. Fine, that's a hard thing to do. There's hundreds of other damn Goldbergs out here wanting to do the same thing and why me?So basically, I'm just asking what do you guys do to sort of help your own selves out, you know? What do you -- what do you do to help bring up that confidence or maintain your calmness, I guess? Sometimes I'm sitting at home, feeling like I should be doing something, working on my dreams, you know. Like doing something that will get me further.Cause sometimes I just can't. You know, I'm sitting at home, at work in a few hours and there's really nothing else to do except watch some TV. But to me it's like wasted time, like I should constantly be doing something to help me get to where I want to be in my life and you know, in one way I guess it's a good thing. You know, I have this determination, but at the same time it freaks me out every day, you know. Scares me every day to think that I have all these dreams and that potentially they might not turn out the way I want them to.I don't know. I -- basically I just -- what are your thoughts on that and like I said, what do you guys and girls do to, you know, just make it all better and, you know, bring out that confidence in yourselves to actually achieve these?Wow, I'm really rambling. This one is going to have to be edited down a lot. Yeah, so anyways, it's really hot up here so I think I'm going to go downstairs and get a really cold drink, so yeah.

Um, and I was taking uh, oh, what do you call that -- call that, um -- um, we -- we were going for a swim, me and my friend, and we hadn't -- we hadn't done that all summer. We both love it -- love to go swimming, uh, bathing, um, but we hadn't done that, because we'd been working so much that summer and we did it last -- the last evening before I left and uh, this is just from that evening. And I'm getting all, like, mmm, thinking about it, because, yeah, she's one of my best friends and -- and uh, it's very beautiful. It was -- it's a very beautiful place, so -﻿I think we need to go a bit faster if this video is not going to be too long because you're not going to be bothered to watch it. And I've -- um, I haven't yet but I'm going to spend, probably hours editing this, so watch it to the end, okay.Anyway, the next clip is, let's have a look, yeah, it's when me and my dad and my brother are leaving the village and, yeah here it is.Hi, YouTube, um, it's so good to see you all. Um, I hardly know what to say that it's been such a long time. Some of you are going, who is that? I haven't seen her in ages and I can totally understand that but. . .Hello, I'm XXXX, um, welcome, to the new subscribers that have joined us, um, during the time I've been away. I don't know what to say just to -- so we'll just get cracking 'cause there's a lot of clips for me to show you and I just need you to understand them; just give me, cut me a bit of slack here. This is what I'm working with, Okay?This is my computer, Okay? And I have to do this. I have to push it, like that, just to get a screen. So, as you can guess, I'm getting a new computer, but this is why it's so difficult for me to make videos. Yeah, so anyway; now that you know that; let's get to the first clip. The first clip I need to show you, is from the summer when we were - um -- just about -- um -- to go off to the wedding. It was thtwenty fourth of July and I promise you, you would meet my new roommate, Emma and you will -- and here's the clip that we'll show you:Hello, YouTube. Um, we're about to go to the wedding, I was talking about; and we're going by bus because we don't really have any other choice.So here we are. Meet Emma, YouTube, go to meet Emma, Emma, YouTube. And this is us looking all nice and dressed for the wedding and this is our lovely transport and it's going to come down this road very soon.So that was Emma. Um, actually the wedding was absolutely beautiful. It was absolutely beautiful. It was actually; I had such a good time. I've -- it must have been the best wedding I've ever been to. I had such an amazingly good time, really. Um, Um, the church that got married in, this is really old church and, and a lot of people get married there during the summers. And just after the wedding, I was there, too. There was another wedding and I think that either the bride or groom must have been Scottish because just when we left, there were other guests coming. And they had this man playing bagpipes outside of the church. And I just filmed it a bit; because a lot of bagpipes. I really do love it. But, bagpipes, that's what you call it.Um, but, I'm going to show you. But, you might want to turn the volume down, just a little bit for this clip, yeah? . Bagpipes, one of these days, I'm going to learn to play it. I'm going to play it for you and you will all unsubscribe.Um, yeah, after the wedding, I went home to my village again and I helped my dad and brother pack everything up and clean the house and these were like one of the warmest days that summer. It was so warm and this is just a clip that I filmed when I was cleaning out one of the rooms and we'd been cleaning for hours and hours, for days, actually. And we were all just so tired of it so, yeah, we just hated it. And we hated the house; we just wanted to leave. Uh, this is a clip of it and, yeah, I -- I watched it just now and I'm almost -- I'm so glad I'm done with that. Well, anyway, here it is:Hello, people! We're cleaning out the house and it's, I'm not kidding but its forty five degrees. It's in the weather and it's so flipping warm and I know, it's been on the record that I have gone through this entire move and this entire clean out of this house singing, It's too hot, it's too hot in this town. My will to live is melting and that's what's got me down. It's too hot.  and it's still stuck in my head and I can't stop singing it. It's terrible. And it's so hot so it's very appropriate, I suppose. But, yeah, I'm going to keep cleaning now. Anyway, I just wanted to pop in to say, hi, rrrr.I just want to show you my village, the village I lived in just bits of pieces of it and the first clip, you'll see, is, just like, um, from the balcony of my friends house and it's not, obviously not, the entire village, but almost. It's not very big. So here's that.﻿After that we went down south in Sweden to our family, um, our relatives that live down there. And we spent a few days with them, and some friends of ours. And, uh, that's also a very beautiful place. You should go to Sweden, really, it's a beautiful country. Um, here are just some bits and pieces of that trip.This next clip is from when we had arrived in Spain. Because, I went down to Spain with my dad and my brother, 'cause they are moving there, as I said. And this is just a clip of my dad making dinner. He likes to cook. He really likes to cook. Um, and it was the first evening in -- in their new apartment so this is when he -- my dad, cooking.﻿You should've been to that taste that because that was really nice. It tasted very, very good.Um, and this last clip is just uh, what I filmed on the plane, because the clouds, it seriously looked like you could walk on them. You know, in movies, when they walk on -- on -- on -- on, like, in the sky on clouds? Yeah, it -- just totally looked like you could -- I so wanted to step out and just walk on it. Would -- probably would not have been a good idea, but this is just -- just what it looked like. It was just -﻿Yeah, so that was it. Um, as I promised you and I know we haven't see each other in a long time. Well actually, it did upload that thing in the Mac Store. Not like I-- that was fun! I've never done that before. And camera, direct upload, I don't know what you call it, um, it was fun. And I have like, a Apple Store -- a, like -- Apple Store clip like everyone famous in the YouTube. Well, anyway. So that was all, I'll see you soon. Um, I don't have an internet in my apartment yet, that's why I'm not on YouTube that much nowadays, but I will get it soon. But it was really nice to see you again and uh, yeah, I'll see you soon.","High","High","High"

I think I just pointed the wrong way; can't remember. Um, yeah, I won best dressed, I got -- I got a tenner, I think, 'cause it was the only win, yeah, so, you know, why not? You know, money is good.Um, I'm trying to think of something else I can talk about. Um, nope. Okay, so this seems like a good natural end to the video. Uh, and before we end it I'm just looking around my room in the hopes that I see something that inspires me. I showed you that I got Murder She Wrote, but I don't know what to say about that.Um, okay, I'll be seeing you then. Bye.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG28","I'm back. Hey guys. Sorry, I haven't made a video in a long time. It's just my computer is broke. You can tell by the graininess of this video, that I'm using my parents' computer. And I might have to do a lot of cuts if I make any videos until my computer is fixed, because this will only record one minute at a time. And if it records over that then the video and audio starts to go out of sync, and then it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse. So, and by the way, I got a new look. Since we last met I have changed my whole look. I've decided to go from wearing just a plain T shirt and jeans to actually layering my T shirt, and a new hat. Yay. Yay to new hats. It gives me bad hat hair though. But it's a cool hat. Yay hats. So, this is just my saying I'm sorry it's taken me a long time to get this video up, and I might be back -- depends on how good my editing skills is. Skills is. My skills are depends on how, if I will make a video or not soon. I might. And, as you can see, I'm not in the best of locations to make a video, and I live with my parents, so they might also be a factor on whether or not I can make a video soon, so, yeah, I guess that's all. Goodbye for now. Wahaha. XXXX. Bye.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG280","It's Saturday, and you're watching XXXX. This week we are talking about what we want to be or what we wanted to be, um, when we grew up. And I don't think it's been that easy a question for everyone, because I think everyone goes through that, uh, you know goes through twenty, thirty time - things that they want to be -- um, just about everyone. I know I've had a lot of things. Um, I had really huge desire to be a singer, like Kaitlin. Um, I never really thought I had what it took to make it so I didn't pursue it in any way. I wanted to be an actress and was really into drama, but oh my gosh, I -- as bad a singer as I am, I am so much worse an actor. Um, but you know I love those things, I do them anyway but, um, but you know, I always thought I'd do something creative.If I was gonna -- teaching was the one thing that I actually thought I might go into. I -- I spent a lot of time just not even knowing. Growing up, I really didn't have any one thing I was like, I want to be this. Um, when I got to like high school when you're really supposed to be thinking about these things, I -- I kind of focused on teaching because -- because I love kids, because, um, because it left me open to, um, any field, really, because you can become a teacher of anything so I still -- you saw that bug this time, right -- okay, I'm pretty sure. Okay. Um, anyway, so I could be anything. I could teach anything, so that was kind of my thing. I just never really had anything I really wanted to focus on. More recently, I thought about going back to school for things but, um, I just don't know. The -- the only thing I really would go back to school for is psychology.I really find the way people thing fascinating, and if you watch YouTube, you probably do, too, if you watch blogs, because that's really what it's all about, is just kind of people watching without being creepy, you know? There is one thing that I can safely say I always wanted to be. And when I'm asked the question what did you want to be when you grew up, it's usually my answer, because it's -- it's absolute -- it's the one thing that I never wavered on and that is, I wanted to be a mommy. And I live that dream. And I am so -- I feel so fortunate to -- to be able to say I do what I wanted to do when I grew up. I um, I'm really, really blessed that I get to stay home a -- and be with my boy, because I was a nanny before I had kids.It was -- it was actually the perfect job, obviously, um, and the fact is I stay -- I ha -- I spent so much more time with these kids than their parents did, and it really made me sad to think that, um, that their parents were missing out on these things. I mean, um, I took care of them from the time they were babies, like, couple months old. I saw first steps, I saw a first word, and I really, I swore I just did not want to be that parent that missed those things, and uh -- not that I'm saying anything bad about those parents because they had to do what they had to do -- um, you know they -- they were just doing what they needed to -- to -- to provide. So, I guess that's about it. Next week -- I'm so excited -- I cannot wait for my Secret Santa present. Thing is like, Kaitlin, I wanna wait. I thought I was gonna have - I was gonna be the only one who was like, open it. I'm a three year old when it comes to Christmas presents.I just, I want to open them, I want to shake them, and then rip 'em open. So, um, I hope I don't have to wait to do that. I will video it, of course, that's the point, but I'm not waiting 'till next Saturday. It's just not gonna happen -- it will be after Christmas. How can I wait 'till after Christmas to open it? That's not gonna happen. But um, you know, but what -- I am so much more excited actually. I'm really excited to get my present and just see what, um, what someone would get for me, because I -- because I'm kind of new and not as well known, you know we don't know each other as well, so it will be interesting to see. But, I'm actually really more excited to see everyone else open their presents. Um, I'm a give -- I'm a giver. I'm a taker, too -- come on -- I like to get -- but I just love to give gifts. I love it.I wish I was filthy rich because I would just buy everyone presents every day of the year. Anyway, tomorrow's XXXX and then we start Secret Santa Week. It'll be so much fun -- make sure to come watch us open our presents -- isn't that the fun of Christmas anyway? Merry Christmas, everybody.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG281","Oh I love you too, I love you too, yes I do, I love you too. Okay. Check them out. That's the whole world looking at you. The whole world. Emmett, say Hi. Anyway this is a response to XXXX, she made this video entitled, XXXX, but it was kind of cool I thought. So everybody who watched her video got tagged, just because we're watching, so I'm going to do the exact same thing. If you're watching me, right now, consider yourself tagged. So anyway, XXXX, um -- you wanted five facts about me. All right, okay, let me think, let me think, let me think. Let me think. You know anything about me Emmett? What should I start with? Okay, um, fact number one. Wow. Okay now don't go and tell me to please say something in German because --Like I can actually think of something on the spot, you know -- don't put me on the spot, okay? I came to America sometimes in September -- oh my God I forgot to pay -- September ninety four, yeah. That's when I came to United States and I've been ever since and I have not spoken any German ever since then. So um -- you know it's true what they say, you don't use it you lose it. So I lost it. It takes me about ten minutes to put a sentence together because I really forgot how to speak Deutsch. But I can still understand you, I can still read it, but you know , no don't ask, please. Okay. Thinking, thinking, thinking. Fact number two. What's fact number two? You don't know? I have two of these. This right here's Emmett and Romeo, well who knows where he is, but uh, I'll grab him later.Yeah I got two boy cats and I love them to bits and pieces even if they bite me, yes . Bye bye, yep. Fact number three. Yeah, fact number three. I am a empath. Now what this means is um -- okay there's uh -- uh -- there's different kind of empaths in the world but um -- what this means is I am very sensitive to people around me. That includes cats too. It means whoever I'm around, I not only feel what this person is feeling, I also kind of sort of become that person, whether I like it or not. I haven't really found a way to control that quite yet, but I'm working on it. But um, yeah I'm around a whole lot of people I can become drained very quickly because I tend to feel everybody all at the same time and -- woo . It's kind of like taking a ride in a blender, you know, so that's one reason why I can never ride a bus, because -- oh my God! Yikes!I'm usually sick for about two weeks after I get off a bus. So I can't do buses because of that. I'm trying to avoid crowds too because it's just not -- it's just not very healthy for me. Okay, that was fact number three, now okay -- number four. Hey I like this bonding thing we're doing here. Let's see -- fact number four. Um -- oh! Fact number four! I'm not smoking anymore! Have you noticed? In none of my videos you see a cigarette popping up no more -- hmm hmm. Yeah, that was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but also the -- one of the best things. Now, the way I got off of cigarettes was with a nicotine patch -- it's called What's it called? Nicquitin CQ -- now that stuff works like a charm. You start with step one. Just slap on the patch, and uh, no more cravings -- completely gone.Now the best -- now the best part about Nicquitin CQ for me anyways was at nighttime, when I went to sleep, oh my God, I had dreams in three D and Technicolor. I couldn't wait to go back to sleep, it was like going to a movie. Uh -- you wake up and you -- and you remember almost everything. It was amazing. Yeah, love when that happens. I'm so glad I did it. That's the best thing I've ever done and I -- I swear, I will never pick up another cigarette ever again. I've gotten stressed again after -- afterwards yeah, but still stayed smoke free and I'm a keep it that way. Now that's probably the reason why I gained a little weight, because when you stop smoking -- um -- you're gonna put on a few pounds -- comes with the territory. But I feel a lot healthier, oh yeah. Now -- um -- okay -- um -- um -- um -- um -- um -- what else -- what else -- what else?What else -- what else -- what else? Fact number five. Fact number five -- here comes Romeo, come here. Ay ay ay ay ah . Ah, what a moomb . Romeo - hey gorgeous. Now this is my slinky little Romeo. Ain't he a angel? Say hi to everybody. You don't feel like it? He doesn't feel like it -- hmm. All right that doesn't really count as a fact but -- that just counts as a cat. So -- gosh -- fact number five. I love making videos of my little sister Stephanie because you know -- the whole impact thing -- the girl takes me to goofy land, every time, never fails.Woah.Exactly.Yeah well I can do this -- Twist it like that -- oh yeah! Here we go -- do it -- do it -- do it -- do it -- do it. like that and squeeze it through your hand .I don't know how -- like this?Like this, like that I did it! Oh my God -- I'm stuck! Help me!She is twelve. When I come around her, I'm twelve, too. So uh -- well -- yeah. Yeah we get pretty stupid, but it's fun, yeah? Geoffrey . Okay and just like Kara I'm a throw away in a fact number six just for the fun of it. Something you probably already know if you've been watching my previous videos, but if you haven't, here's fact number six. I am the biggest Michael Jackson fan in the entire world, yes I am. Oh, let me throw in one more fact. Fact number seven -- I have a new website. It's called XXXX. tk. It comes with a chat. Well I had to make a brand new chat because the other one wouldn't let me in any more for some unknown reason, so it's got a new chat.And, come check it out. I know I'm sorry XXXX, I know it took me forever to make this video -- um -- well, there's always something that keeps coming up, so -- I'm glad I finally got around to it because it's been in the back of my mind, like I owe this girl a video -- give it! And in XXXX tradition, if you have been watching me up until now, consider yourselves tagged. I give you seven facts about me, now give me your seven facts. I love this bonding thing, don't you? I saw different people .Ah -- ah! My butt hurts.Her butt hurts.Ah!She broke her house today -- and don't do drugs!","High","High","High"

The very first image released from Eclipse is finally available in super, super, super high quality. You can click the link in the info to check it out. Zoom in on it; whatever you want to do.Um, now I do realize that this, uh, has been out for a few of weeks. I actually saw it in entertainment weekly, like, a month ago, but, um, you know, it was just, like, a picture in the magazine and you couldn't really do anything with that see it in. So, um, now, of course, it is available online in super high quality, like I said.Uh, it's kinda tough to, like, say what your opinion is on a picture, because there's not really a whole lot going on in the picture. But, um, I'm very glad to see the good meadow back from New Moon, ah, as compared to the not meadow from Twilight, so that is a plus. Let me know in the comments what you think about the photo; if you can make opinions about it, really.

"VLOG283","Okay, so I've just come in, um, from the dentist, and my mouth is totally numb. I'm not even joking, from that side to there, part of it is totally numb, so I thought I'd do a little video blog, because I'm not sure that's been done -- it probably has been done before, but I thought it'd be pretty funny, because little -- oh my, oh my God, it's going towards that side, what the fuck's going on?And I don't know who'll see this, um, but I feel like a bit of a freak. Um, I can't thaw half my face. All it was for was a filling, and he got a needle out and numbed me. What's interesting is when I was led there. Um, I asked him; I says, ah, I wonder who invented, um, you know, the chemicals that make you numb. Well, I say chemicals, but I have no idea what you call it.And yeah, he mentioned something about, um, the Amazon Forest, you know, how they found it there first and, you know, did their research, which I thought was pretty cool, because I had no idea that it all started in a rainforest. Amazon Rainforest. I think it's a rainforest. Isn't it? I've no idea. Forest, rainforest, same thing; just one's got more rain than the other.Okay, an update on the numbness, it's actually still numb, from there to there. Oh yeah, and the reason that I look down there is because it's got like a little display, where I can look at myself. So that's why people are like, oh, what do you look down there for? Why do you look down there? Why don't you look into the camera? It's because there's a little display thing down there, and I looked it just to make sure I'm in -- in shot, and my jacket has magically disappeared.Okay, so I'm gonna Google, um, how long the numbness should last. I'm actually search on Google and have a look. Okay, let's have a look, um, dental numbness, uh, plus how long does it last. Yes, I am a really fast typer. Um, yeah. Okay, I'm just reading. Um, typically after twenty four hours your mouth should relatively be back to normal. Twenty four hours -- what? Yeah, I don't know if I can last twenty four hours, God, that's ages. Okay, so thanks for watching this rather, um, random video about the dentist, dreaded dentist, and I guess I will see you soon.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG284","﻿Hello, YouTubers. Um, in my last video I actually had used the music from a local band. I figured I'd just, um, give you a little bit more detail on it. It's a band called Sproll. It's actually a band from my home town. Um, I actually know one of the members in the band who I did work with 'til recently.Um, the music is awesome as you already heard. Um, the song in particular which was um, Eyes have Spoken is on disc which their first EP called Soft Science.Um, now they have another follow up album called Radio that just came out. Um, you can get information at www dot sproll dot ca or at maplemusic dot com. You can actually order the CDs from there.Um, just we're gonna give you a little explanation on that music and uh, but you should go and check them out, they're really awesome. I haven't actually had the chance to see them live yet. I keep missing their shows so I'm hoping that I will get to see the next show so I promise, Glen , I will make it to your next show.Um, there it is, that's it.

"VLOG285","Today I would like to bring you a motivational speech from the regions of Waco, America. A short time ago in a county not too far away I addressed you, the YouTube community, by way of an over eloquent vernacular. I again wish to do so and would ask that you continue to view this video to hear the rest of the speech.War on Terror, an almost trite declaration by the US Government in this day and age, begs the question as to how they will fight such a war on terror. With little Suzie terrified of tarantulas and thirty year old Marvin still concerned about what life is like outside of his mother's household, it is a wonder how the service men and women of our country can take on such a giant as terror.I, however, would like to offer a solution. And to those of you chemistry folk, by solution I do not mean a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances, but rather an answer to an enduring question within the confines of American society. We must begin by creating an altruistic society in which the people do not think for themselves. By controlling the thoughts and minds of Americans through outlets such as CNN and Fox News and -- and/or the National Enquirer, we will discover that terror only exists in our minds.Once people are no longer thinking for themselves, we should initiate a false war on terror, on horror, on love, and other emotions that could at one point or another inflict pain on a humanoid. Accomplishing these things would do wonders for the society that we live in today. And by wonders, I do not mean things that happened in the Old Testament or the Bible, but rather a strange unity amongst the people, considering the fact that they're being controlled by the same outlet.With that I conclude my antagonizing and otherworldly speech. Take what you like, leave what you hate, for this is the American idea of hope, change, and something else that I can't remember.","High","High","High"

Also my hair is not the right color or look at all. Really everything about me doesn't look like him but whatever. I am here to tell you that I have information for you, information about XXXX.

Hey XXXX, I wanna stalk you. Hey XXXX, I wanna stalk you. You know, and, uh, the video, it actually answers a lot of those questions. You know like: A) His name's XXXX, it's in there. B) His name's XXXX. I think he says, there's something about ninjas in there, he likes ninjas, but he also likes pirates. He wants to combine them or something, I don't know, whatever.

But it should be pretty entertaining and for you guys who are looking at the first half going, eh this is kind of boring, check out the second half of the video. Its actually -- I find most of the jokes are probably in the second half. Check it out, links in the side bar, great interview, brought to you by anti work .

The exact address of where he lives, uh, his Facebook account, his MS -- no, his, uh, his MySpace, his pager number, uh, his cell phone number, his house number, his Xbox live gamer tag.

"VLOG29","﻿Hi. I'm XXXX, and this is XXXX, a blog series where I tell you who my dream celebrity boyfriend is. I tried having real boyfriends for awhile, but it didn't work out. Not because I'm gay; I'm not. But because me and regular, real, boys just don't seem to get along. Like, I'll say, Hey, why don't you let me bring my best friend into bed? And they'll go, Oh, that sounds great. But then when I bring her in, they can't handle it. Her name is XXXX, and we sleep together every night, as friends.They also don't like it that I still suck my thumb sometimes. Like, that's such a big deal. Also, I don't perform oral sex. So, I decided, that this week's dream celebrity dream boyfriend is the awesomest  dude ever. He's so cute, he's a rainbow of fruit flavors of different ethnic combinations. He's awesome at sports, and he loves to do it. I give you: Tiger Woods.I know what you're thinking. Sarah Benincasa, this has to be some kind of comedy joke. This is wild? Why would you want to be with Tiger Woods? He cheated on his beautiful wife and, make that two, beautiful, multi ethnic babies. He is a jerk. And there I say, Stop. No he isn't. He's a hero. Here's why. Tiger Woods has single handedly proven that Asian dudes can be fuck monsters too. And that's awesome. I mean, when was the last time you saw an Asian American dude venerated in our culture as a super sex symbol? Nev'? I mean, I'm super into Harold from Harold & Kumar, but I doubt the rest of you are, 'cause you're racists.I'm not racist, and neither is XXXX. And we think Tiger Woods is great. He's half Asian and he's had sex with, like, all the white women in the whole world, except for me. I hope that Tiger's watching and I want him to know that if he wants to call me, he can. And he can take me out on a date to Outback Steakhouse and we can get a Blooming Onion. I'll eat it and I'll make out with him, but uh uh uh, right after -- and then I'll eat a steak 'cause it's a steakhouse and then I'll dig my tongue in his mouth blalala and it'll be so awesome.Tiger, you're the man for me. I love you, and I think that you are a civil rights hero, like Martin Luther King, Jr. or Mario Lopez. This has been this week's edition of Celebrity Dream Boyfriend Dream, and I'm six. I'll see you at three. Bye. Say goodbye, XXXX. Bye.","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG290","﻿Part three. Okay, um, the argument against homosexuality is that, aside from a biblical sense, is that a lot of homosexual -- allowing homosexual people to have children would be detrimental for the children. And let's back track a little bit and review why, apparently, it would be detrimental to the children.No. Let's backtrack a little bit and discuss the idea of homosexual marriage. The idea of ho -- actually let's backtrack a lot and discuss another reason why you wouldn't want to give homosexuals marriage. Namely that marriage should only be give to groups of people that are -- procreate. So the argument of religious people, and they don't have their precious bible to back them up, is that marriage is a function that is and always shall be, solely for procreation. And since gay people, you know, it -- it doesn't work, you know, and lesbians, you know? Not much getting done there in way of procreation. Not much getting done in the way of procreation in a, um, homosexual relationship. That's honest. That's true.And I've heard this argument a million times before, so I'm just going to say it again, old people can't marry then, infertile people can't marry then, you know, um. What about, uh, women who have gone through menopause, can they get married anymore? And then if the couple should get married and decide not to have children, you know, are they, like, committing some grand atrocity? They decide not to populate the chil -- they decide not to populate the Earth. Or, what happens if a couple has kids and then neither of them can have anymore kids? All of the sudden, should the marriage just be erased?The true definition of marriage is not an idea of procreation. Certainly that's -- certainly, it's part of it. But the original definition of marriage was an ide -- was a social contract for a male to gain property, mainly the female. The female was considered property. Now, that really throws it in -- that really, sort of, throws a wrench in the whole operation when women all of a sudden aren't considered property anymore, you know? Because, all of the sudden, you know, it's not an idea of property.This idea that marriage is -- is for love purposes, it really is a twentieth century idea. You know, of course we've carried it into this century, but it has not been around for more than a hundred years or so. Um, marriage was a contract. It is a contract, still. It's a social contract. You're stating to your governing body that you two are going to sort of coexist -- co -- uh, you're going to exist as one; let's just say it that way. So, in exchange for entering into this social contract, the government gives you certain benefits and that is a lot of what this argument is about.For fighting for gay marriage benefits is that, it's not even the title of gay marriage that we're getting after. It's the idea that if you do not allow gay people to marry, you're denying them these benefits, these rights that are granted to heterosexual married couples. Heterosexual married couples have almost number -- an almost infinite number of rights.Like, the, just so you know, the most -- the most obvious example, um, like, if one -- if one partner is in the hospital, the other partner can go in there. They're treated as family. Now, if a gay couple, if one of the -- one of the partners was to be in the hospital, the doctor can tell that person not to go in. They can keep them out. Because they don't have to. Because they're not married.And I'll get into the -- the idea of civil union versus marriage. I have my own opinion about that, but, um, yeah. So the idea that homosexuality in marriage will destroy the American family. I just have to say, I feel sorry for people who are so insecure about their own marriages that they have to blame homosexuals for destroying their marriages. The only marriages homosexuals have ever destroyed are sham marriages that homosexuals entered into to protect their own identity. And the only reason they destroyed them is because they were honest with themselves, so you know, really, homosexual marriage -","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG291","﻿XXXX, are you okay? Are you okay, XXXX? XXXX, are you okay? Are you okay, XXXX? Oh, hey guys, um, this is our XXXX got suspended and possibly forever -- basically forever, yeah. Um, okay, um, it was maybe a year ago, um, maybe less, maybe not half a-year ago but maybe a little bit more that a half a-year ago. I have first got my -- actually when did XXXX come out? Was that, it was in May of two thousand and eight? I think. Maybe. I'm not sure. Um, but that's why I put this video up. The video was Will Farrell's The Landlord. Everyone knows that video. Everyone knows, um, who's battling the internet about The Landlord video. So I put it not knowing about YouTube's -- this is when they first started, ah, do the YouTube, you're going to get zapped into suspension or deletion if you put a video up copyrighted by a celebrity or anything. So I didn't know about it, uh, they first started to do it. So it was this -- I posted a video maybe at two o'clock or three o'clock in the morning, um, because -- am I frozen right now? Yeah I think I was frozen I'm not sure. Sorry, my computer may have just said that. Um, but it was at two or three o'clock in the morning because I remember my sister went to The Dark Night opening at midnight and I stayed up all night on the computer so I put The Landlord up. Maybe five minutes, ten minutes later YouTube sent me a thing, they've took it down saying -- well they've made it unavailable for people to watch. They said, if you don't take this down we will suspend and delete your account. So I'm like, okay. So I delete it. Half a-year, a year later comes, which was a couple of weeks ago and I try to log into my account and it says, this account -- you can not access this account, change email, or something like that. So I message YouTube and I say on a -- on email, and they are no help at all. And Google -- I can't call them because they don't have people to talk to. It's really confusing. Well, maybe they do. It's just really confusing for me. So I send it in and they say -- they also suspended another account that I made for Shinsei . It's an Anime, um, they also suspended that too, so it is like a double whammy. I was pretty popular on there, too. I had a lot of subscribers but still many views on my videos but it's not my videos. But anyways, let's get to the point, and on the email it said the things that made me get suspended. It had The Landlord on it and what I was thinking was, um -- my mom was screaming I'll give you a freaking buck. I don't know if you guys heard it, but yeah, dismind her she's , I don't know. Okay, but um, okay um, where was I? Oh yeah, so they say, we suspended you because of The Landlord and it said you have to settle the dispute with um, with um, with Will Ferrel or who made it, maybe from Udie dot com. I don't know, but I am pretty sure that it was Will Ferrel. It was the creator of the video I think they said, so yeah. So that's pretty impossible, um, so that's that and even, they said even if I settle the dispute with him that I probably wouldn't get my subscribers, my friends and my videos back. So if, you know, um, and so that's that with it and so I made topic revised. I'm going to make all, I'm going to redo all the episodes of um, of, ah, A D-I T-O A-L S, is that the for it? I think -- I think I said it right in the abbreviations and um, Udderface , I'm bringing Udderface back and um, and so, and so yeah, that is what's going on. I, um, there's no more highly logical of what you have read on my channel. And so yeah, basically, yeah, I am never going to get my channel back. So this is the new home, so everyone, um, I have a Twitter account. I -- I just really want people to start following me. So um, and so, yeah, that's about it. So bye, you guys, um, subscribe please, so yeah, uh, bye.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG292","﻿Hey everybody, it's October thirtieth, two thousand and nine. I am and I am not a vegetarian, but I probably should be. As you can probably tell from the title I'm presumably going to give this video -- there's probably a title right above my head as you watch this on the internet.For a variety of reasons, vegetarianism makes sense. The first thing -- typically the first thing I've read anyway, that vegetarians or vegans -- which is vegetarian plus, you know, they don't even drink milk, which would be hard for me, man. I always drink milk. Milk is cool -- healthy and everything.So, the first thing that I typically hear vegetarians bring up is the moral issue. That animals have certain rights. And we shouldn't kill them and eat them and I've always sort of wondered about that. I certainly believe we have to protect the environment, you know. The environment produces all of our air, for instance. And if we pollute the air, we will not have any more air to breathe and the humans will all die. So you know, let's not do that. And a variety of other things. The environment is complicated, I don't like -- you know, you start -- they're cutting the rainforest and stuff and cause all these other things that eventually -- just cause crap for people, you know. So certainly you should respect the natural world in that broad extent.Now, how much respect do you give individual animals, though? Particularly if you -- you know, got -- get yourself a whole bunch of cows or whatever that you can produce, sustainably, there would be more cows every new year whatever and you know, more cows are born and stuff and they're replacing the old ones, and there's no particular pollution going on. Though there are separate things with the way we mess with our livestock and jack them up with a whole bunch of hormones and overly high doses of antibiotics even when they're not sick and so forth, which is great for profit margins but not necessarily great for us people that eat all of that and other things that can cause in the long run. There's stuff that's -I like organic food, myself. I'm not going to eat a whole lot of it, but when I can get it, I like organic. Because it means actual organic and not just they called it organic, 'cause it -- it's complicated.Animals individually, when there's no, you know, grand environmental impact, how much rights do they have? It's a thorny issue, you know, um, we don't typically eat dogs -- you ever notice that dogs are like, you know, intelligent and we let dogs as pets and stuff. Wonder if there's some sort of movement where people get cows as pets. Maybe we'd stop eating cows, you know, or pigs or whatever other things you like to pet, it would be kinda weird to eat it -- ish.You can get into all sorts of issues as -- it comes down to philosophy. The morality of what constitutes, you know, a thing, a human type thing that needs to be protected. Like is a dog, like, you know, one tenth of a human sort of a thing, you know? They deserve a certain amount of protection. Is a cow like one twentieth of a human in terms of how much moral weight it has? I don't know really. It's complicated -- ah, there's the moral issue here. Hard to say.But discarding that entirely, I still ought to be a vegetarian, why? Well, its' healthy. I looked it up. It's actually healthier, you get all your nutrients from vegetables -- what, I'm sorry -- sorry, from non meat products, grains, fruits, vegetables uh, et cetera, et cetera. You think -- well you can get like -- you get protein from meat, right? Yeah, you're better off getting your protein from other stuff. I think like peanuts have protein or nuts of some kind. Oh gee, I don't even know on the top of my head, but I remember looking this up. And as it happens, we're uniquely evolved to need meat. Like if all the teeth of a mouth, for instance, even the pointy one is actually, you know, part of a normal plant eating mouth and such. There's no vital thing that you get only from meat and, you know, everyone knows we ought to eat more vegetables just to be healthy in general. Well, if you're a vegetarian, you'd probably eat up a lot more vegetables, one would think.And then getting back to the environment thing. Meat takes up a lot more resources. the math is on this, but like you could have x amount of corn or whatever to feed a cow which would feed so many people, but like, if you didn't have the cow eat the corn, and you cut out the middle then you end up feeding like a whole lot more people with the original amount of corn -- if everyone was eating corn, or whatever. But we're not, we're eating cows, which is much less efficient, takes up much more land, much more resources.And I don't know if you've been attention, just last couple of decades or something, but somewhat iffy on the resources bit. The population going up, granted, not up as fast as was predicted. Uh, global warming getting worse so thankfully there's more, um, awareness of it, so hopefully we'll turn something around here at some point. I mean just the general principle that I like to divide -- not using more resources than I need, which I'm not going to pretend to be a saint in that regard, but I like the principle of it anyway.You eat the thing which is, you know, could feed more people -- eat them in the more efficient sort of way. And that way happens to be healthier. Put those two together, that is enough for -- yeah, I should be a vegetarian.So I've been thinking about that one the last few weeks and I've been eating less meat at meals. I can get more salad and stuff. Haven't really switched over yet. But I ought to and the rest of the world ought to and we'd save ourselves a lot of resources and a lot of headaches of a very, you know, medical crap that happens because we don't get enough of random nutrients that we ought to get. I don't think those multivitamin pills are really going to help you with that. For some reason, they're not exactly sure why, but for some reason it's so much better to get nutrients out of actual food than a pill. Like the pill may help but not half as much as the food.It's healthier. Being a vegetarian, it's more efficient, and thus, you know, better for the environment -- you use less resources. And there might even be a moral question to boot in there, so yeah. I ought to be a vegetarian, I ought to, getting around to that, and I'm pretty sure the rest of the world ought to be to.Or at least, you know, you don't have to go one hundred percent vegetarian, but like eat less meat maybe? Could you -- could we all try that? We'd all of us just eat like ten percent less meat than you would otherwise. You know, just see if that works. Take this a step at a time, I don't know. Thanks for watching, see you.","High","High","High"
"VLOG293","I haven't this much writing this week because I just haven't been motivated, and I noticed that a lot of my friends that were doing it haven't really been either so this poem is for them, Christine, Kara, Paige and Kaitlin , and for myself.The words won't come. Minutes and hours and days of staring at the blank sheet, and yet nothing comes to mind. What should they say? What should they do? You have no idea. How could you? You don't know yourself what to do or what to say, when you feel lost, when you feel empty. What's left to give, when you've already taken everything you have and already put it in? There's nothing left to do or say, you have nothing.And in reading that, I just realized that it's kind of about the ChartJackers' Single which is out today. It makes me happy.

"VLOG295","For those of you watching XXXX for the first time, welcome. I'm XXXX, your host. I have been making these XXXX for three years now. That's the same amount of time that I have been living in Japan and probably the same amount of time, I would say, that I have been studying that Japanese language. A little bit before I came to Japan I studied too, but I just round it out to three years. If you're watching this and it's your very first video that you have ever watched on my channel, awesome, great. For those of you who have followed my channel for a long time I'm sorry, but this is probably going to be a boring video. And say a lot of things that you've already heard many times before, okay? But what this video is here for is to condense answers for many, many of the same questions I get over and over again that I have answered before or, number two, are private things that I'm just never going to answer. One main thing that I ask is before you send any question please scroll through my videos, I have them listed in order, and with every video I've listed the topic that I covered on the FAQ. If you see the topic go ahead and check it out and see if I cover what you are about to ask. If I do not cover the aspect that you wanted, please tell me the video number that you've referenced and what aspect you want and I'll be happy to send you an e mail explaining more if need be. Otherwise, please watch this video first and then check out all the topics in my other ones before you think about sending a question. Otherwise, you're -- you are going to get referenced to this video again or I'll just never answer your question. Thanks for watching.Let's start with that number one question I get. Number one and that is Scott, what jobs can I get in Japan? A lot of people ask me this again, again, and again. What jobs can I get in Japan. Well, that's definitely a sign that you haven't watched any of my videos because in twenty to about thirty of my videos over the length of about a hundred videos, I've said again and again that teaching English is the only job that you can get unless you speak fluent or native level Japanese. Unless you speak fluent Japanese or have a spouse visa, that means you are married to a Japanese person and are staying in Japan under a spouse visa. There's some people that are in the military, that's a totally different story. Okay they have come over with the military, I'm not including that, okay? And then there are some people who are civilians in Japan who work for the military and that's a totally different story too, okay? You're still coming over with the military in my opinion. For those of you who have no connection to the military and are just trying to get over here and get a job, unless you speak fluent, and I mean native level Japanese, you are not going to get any other job than teaching English. Please do not send me an e mail asking how can I be a construction worker in Japan, how can I be a scientist in Japan, can I be a doctor in Japan. No!Number one, you need a four year degree or the equivalent to a bachelor's degree in anything, it can be anything, to teach English here in Japan. This will allow you to get past emigration and get approved for a work visa. And then you send all your information in to emigration and then they approve you for the work visa. In my first video I stated that you couldn't switch from a tourist visa, but Tokyo Sam uh, updated me on that and said that yes it is possible, I did it. So you can come over here on a tourist visa, search for a job and get approved. It is possible.The other rule is a spouse visa. You can come over here on a spouse visa, which you can stay on permanently, okay? You don't need to switch to a work visa, but you can also land a job that way as well. Uh, some people I have even seen forego having a four year degree and get a job with a spouse visa. So that's the other exception. Sometimes people even get other jobs but they're on a spouse visa. They're not on a work visa. Other than that, there is no other job that you can get, okay?Some people have asked me, Scott can I teach my native language which is Spanish, French, et cetera, et cetera. Yes, okay? There are jobs like that here in Japan where people do teach languages outside of the English realm, okay? Obviously Japan is an educated place; they want to learn more that just one other language. Um, so yes you can get a job doing that. They're not as common as teaching English but they do exist and you can get approved for a work visa on those languages. But unless you speak native or fluent level Japanese, there is no other job you can get other than teaching language. Nothing, nothing.You can get a little extra work in the food service area or a bar, okay? Some are oriented towards gagin of have a gagin theme so they hire gagin, okay? But those people do not get work visas and Japan will not approve a work visa for working at one of those places.Now there is exceptions to the rule, okay, but they are very few and far between. I could probably count them one hand. For instance, in Tokyo there are hotels that have an entire industry built around gagin who come over here for business trips. And their entire staff is gagin and they are on, uh, special visas but those people have worked really hard to get those jobs and they are an exception to the rule, okay? Don't ask me about how to get those. I've never worked in that business here in Japan. I have no idea. I'm cannot connect you with that.Now some people do come over here as just English teachers and work their way up to different jobs. They start to learn the language. They start to get networking. They start to get connections outside of that realm and they move into other things, great. If you have any doubt, Google it. That's always the best information that I can give you.What companies hire overseas? I don't know anymore. It used to me Nova. I've heard of oth -- Kiawas , which is an English conversation school that hire overseas, but a lot has changed since the economy has bombed. And it's not as common to get hired overseas. If it does happen, you will know in your country. I don't know here in Japan, okay? No company comes to me and says, hey Scott let your viewers know that we are now hiring overseas. If they do it you will have to Google it, you will have to research it, you will have to find out that information yourself.As for the JET Programme I have never worked in the JET Programme, um, from what I hear it is the cream of the crop. They treat you really well. You have to contact your Japanese embassy to learn about it. If you want to know more about the JET Programme, I suggest contacting somebody who's actually worked in it like Myargonauts, another J blogger, and possibly he can give you a lot of information on him. But, uh, you know, he might be bombed with a lot of e mails too, so don't always expect a response.And even though I do work as an English teacher here in Japan, I don't have any connections for you, okay? Please do not write to me asking if I can get you a job in Japan. Please do not ask me if I have any networking abilities that can land you a job, if I can get you an interview or if I can hook you up with the board of education in my area. No, no, and no. Okay?Finally, the most basic breakdown for getting an English teaching job in Japan. Step one, look for a company. Some hire overseas, but it's rare. Most hire directly within Japan. So your first step is probably going to be coming to Japan or finding that company that hires overseas.Step two, go for an interview, all right? Send your resume. They'll send you an e mail or contact you letting you know they want an interview with you. Go ahead and prepare for that. All the same rules apply just like any interview. Dress very professionally. Use professional language.Some are going to require you to teach a sample lesson. In that case be ready to teach for the age group that you would possibly teaching for the job. Some are for kids. Some are for adults. It all depends. It will vary with the job that you have applied for.Part three, if you are accepted, if you are accepted the company will most likely sponsor you a work visa. You must work a certain amount of hours to get a work visa. As of right now, I am unsure as the total hours that you need in which to get a work visa. I believe it's twenty eight or more hours, but I could be wrong so don't hold me to -","High","High","High"

"VLOG297","The Project for Awesome has begun. So, to XXXX, this is the best time of year, because this is when we dominate YouTube with charity and goodness and awesomeness. And it's one of the days that we never forget to be awesome. And, you know what, it's gonna be great. And so when you're done with this video, comment it, and rate it, and then go to a bunch of other videos, and comment those, and rate those, and start conversations in the comments to get them on the front page of YouTube, so that people start realizing how important charity is -- and it's gonna be Awesome. So, that's why we call it the Project for Awesome. Imagine a world where you have no choice for you, but your coffee. It was at Starbucks. That was the only place -- I mean it was one corporation. It had dominated everything else and all local businesses were gone, and the only place where you could buy your coffee was at Starbucks. Not much choice there. You can't decide for yourself what coffee you like better, you can't, you know, buy cheaper coffee. In -- it's -- it's -- our economy depends on local businesses, and that's why I am going to support what is not necessarily a charity, but it is a non profit organization, to support local businesses and help them thrive, and it's called the American Independence Business Alliance.So, how it works is local business decide to form alliances within their towns, and overall, all these alliances are springing up across America. And so, when you go on the website for the whole thing you can link to other cities websites, and sometimes you can even find your own city, and you might not have known this organization even existed, but it does. And you can go to the website, which is gonna be linked in the doobly doo. And then, when you get to the cities page, they have a list of all the businesses in that city that are part of the alliance, and that's a good place to start if you don't know where to shop locally.Not all cities have this, but a lot of them do, and if you find your city on that list then great, and go there, and shop there for Christmas. This is a great time of year to decide where you're going to shop.And the reasons why you should do this, are also gonna be linked in the doobly doo. It's an article, and I'm just gonna tell you a little bit about this research project that was done in Austin, Texas, comparing franchises and local businesses -- found out that on average -- at a Franchise, thirteen dollars out of a hundred goes back to the community in wages or uh, in taxes, things like that, thirteen dollars. At a local business, for every hundred dollars spent, forty five dollars goes back in taxes and wages and things, into the community. I mean, imagine how much more that's helping. Local businesses have to pay city taxes, and that goes to making your roads better -- it improves the community a lot. And then, you also have the fact that the businesses start to grow. If everyone engages in this kind of business, it starts to make local areas get stronger, and then when local areas get stronger the whole economy of America starts to get stronger. There's a lot of information on the website, and you can find out why it's important to buy locally. So, go to your local businesses and do your Christmas shopping there.","Low","High","High"

Wouldn't it be at the top if they made a Zelda movie? What's your favorite band, song, genre? Well, if they made a Zelda movie, I would be totally psyched for that. And to be honest, it's actually a big dream of mine to direct a Zelda movie. That would be the pinnacle of anything I ever direct in my whole life would be a legend of Zelda movie. Not sure if I can do it, but in a fan film, I can definitely do it. But, um like a Hollywood feature film, I would totally go see it, totally. I don't really have a favorite band, but my favorite genre of music has been like R and B , Rap and Hip Hop. Why? Because I kinda grew up with, so it's just ingrained in me. And yup, the music nowadays is not as good as it was when I was growing up. But, saying that makes me feel old, but I do believe that. And my favorite song probably has to be Iris, by the Goo Goo Dolls. What are your thoughts about Nintendo to bring back the Koopalings in news from Meyer Brothers Wii. Well, it seems that Nintendo only thinks the Koopalings belong in two D , but I would love to see them in a three D game. That's all I have to say. You know, I didn't really schedule when is coming out. How about you give me a reasonable date? And I'll try to do it by then. To be honest I'm not really interested in the Zelda hand held games. They are kind of continuing where Wind Waker left off and, ah, it's not a big deal.Who's the one person you would really like to meet? It could be anybody. The one person that I would really like to meet is Robert Rodriguez, because he's the one that really inspired me to be a film maker and showed me that you can make a movie with a shoestring budget as long as you are really creative and have a good story.If you could remake any movie which would you do and why? I really wouldn't remake anything. Um, remaking movies in Hollywood, especially this decade, has been a business of its own because of our economic times that we have been going through lately. And, ah, it's usually, it's just a big marketing strategy because, ah, Hollywood knows that if they remake something from the past and you're familiar with that franchise you're more likely to go see that than something that's original. Because you might see something that's original and, like, oh I don't know about that movie. I don't know if I should see that but if a new Miami Vice comes out, a new Friday the Thirteenth, a new Nightmare on Elm Street. Oh wow, they remade this movie. I know that movie. I know those characters and then you go pay to see it. It happens all the time and that's what's making money for Hollywood and they're going to keep doing it until they run out of remakes to do. And then they are just going to be remaking the remakes which makes a lot of sense.Why don't you do any more movie giveaways as a movie messenger? Well, in the beginning I was giving a way DVDs but then when I did As Good as it Gets and Marley and Me I had contests for those videos and nobody participated. And I had bought four copies of As Good as it Gets and I bought a really good copy of Marley and Me. And I spent like fifty bucks on those and nobody participated in the contest, I was like, wow, that was like a waste of money. So, then I just threw away the contest thing and I was like, eh, forget about it. And, ah, that's that. But I do plan to bring back the DVD giveaways in the future. So, don't worry about that, um, it's going come -- come again soon. Okay?Do you like heist movie and if so, what is you favorite? And if Nintendo suddenly went bankrupt, what would you think you would do? And if Nintendo went bankrupt, I'm pretty sure either Sony or Microsoft would buy them. If the internet died, what do you think would happen? Chaos would ensue. Do you know the movie preview critic here on YouTube? No.Well, basically, this question's asking me, would I rather play Ocarina of Time for the rest of my life, or watch The Shawshank Redemption for the rest of my life? I would have to say, play Ocarina of Time for the rest of my life, and here's why. Because, I think if I watch Shawshank Redemption, like, a million times, I would probably get sick of it.But I think, if I was, like, deserted on some, like, desert island, and I had to play Ocarina of Time, em, it wouldn't be as bad, because, I mean, even though I'd be alone, and you know -- think about, like, that movie Cast Away. Like, if I was like him, and I was on that island with Ocarina of Time, I would probably just talk to the characters on the screen like they were real, kinda like he did with the volleyball. I'd be like, hey Madeline hey Talin; how's it going? You know, just walking through the stages, and talking to all those townsfolk like they were real people. I mean, I'd be crazy, but I'd at least -- I'd have friends, sort of.I actually love the Smash Bros. series to death. Um, bear characters to use the regular Smash Bros. Pikachu, Smash Bros. Melee Pikachu, and Smash Bros. Brawl/Kirby, because they give to Pikachu. Best version? Melee, 'cause it's a lot harder and takes a lot more skill to play.What are you thoughts about the remake of the 80's animated movie Akira? And have you seen Battle Royale yet? Uh, the remakes again. Uh, they should be fine; I don't know. I mean they're remaking everything so, who knows? As long as they don't make it like that Dragon Ball Z movie that just came out, it should be okay. And Battle Royale? No, I haven't seen it, but I will let you know when I do.What was the most violent movie that played as you were growing up? Believe or not, it was Mortal Kombat and that's why I loved it so much. And that's why parents were whooping out about it and that's why senators went crazy over the violence. And if you play it today? It's pretty damn tame.Would you consider doing A Link To the Past Walkthrough, and what is your opinion on remakes in general? A Link To the Past Walkthrough; that would take forever to do. Um, do you ever need A Link To the Past Walkthrough? Mmm, I don't know. If you really want one, I'll think about it. I want to make my Walkthroughs kinda different from other people's Walkthroughs. I want 'em to do interactive. So if there's a way I can figure out inter active, sure, I'll do Link To the Past. And I think you already heard what I said about remakes, so I don't believe you should do one. No. I mean, Hollywood's only doing it to make money, but that -- that understandable.What's your favorite RPG? I think I answered this one already, but if I didn't, it's Final Fantasy Nine.What games out there that are loved by everyone you don't like? In my last question I asked, What you up for a series?  Well, I have another. What kind of structure they use to make it look good? Lighting, camera angles, that kinda thing.A game that everybody likes that I don't like? Freaking Halo on Xbox. And more tips to help you make your web series. It's gonna take forever, like, a whole other video to do, so I'm gonna put links to the description to help you out their YouTube tips to help with your lighting and your videography and that kind of thing. So that should help you out, and other links to other sites and that can help you out too.﻿Do I like Polk fiction? Man, this movie is amazing and this DVD, just a collector's edition, has so much bonus material, I just couldn't stand it -- it just -- this is what DVDs are all about. So if you haven't -- if you don't have this DVD, it's a collector's edition of Polk Fiction; I recommend it -- highly recommend it. Um, I love Quentin Tarantino's movies.I just bought In Glorious Bastards on DVD -- bought this one at Target 'cause it came with a soundtrack. Best Buy was selling this for twenty four ninety five, just by itself, but if you buy this at Target right now, it comes with the -- the movie soundtrack too, so that's pretty freaking awesome.Favorite TV show of all time is the Wonder Years.What are your thoughts on the Catsylvania series and the direction it took after Symphony of the Night? Well, on the NES, I had all the Catsylvania games as a kid. I loved number three the best, because you can play as different characters so I always played as Aloe Card, um 'cause you can fly around with a bat and pretty much fly over like the whole stage. I mean, if you have enough magic. And I played the Super , Super Catsylvania Four, which I thought was pretty amazing.Then when I got to Symphony of the Night, it was a really great step up for the series, but since then, it's like all the games are trying to be like Symphony of Night, but not as good, so um, I'm not really excited about the newer ones all the time, because they're always -- mimic Symphony of the Night, like the and the DS. I've kinda played a couple of those. I was like, ahh. It's just like, been there, played that.","High","High","High"
"VLOG299","Hi, guys. Uh, this is, uh, XXXX. Also known as a XXXX now to my more popular fan base, or, the fan base to which I am more popular, or something. I -- I don't even know, you know. I -- I'm through with trying to come up with witty introductions because I ain't got 'em today. I'm too tired for that shit. Thankfully I do have like six days off, so maybe I can try to do some catching up on things, but. A lot of people told me I need to make a blog on here again, so here I am. Here I am making a blog. Whoopty doo.And people have also asked me this, um -- I -- I guess people can sense that I've been a little out of sorts, lately, that I've been a little unfocused, kind of not all there. And it's true. I've had quite a bit on my mind lately, so maybe this is the place where I can come and kinda talk about it, I guess, I don't know. I figure, I didn't make this channel for nothing. Might as well use it for something. The thing is, I don't want to come on here and sit here and piss and moan, you know, because that's just not my style, these days, to do that. I'd rather do that, you know, to my video camera for my future self than to sit here and burden other people with having to listen to it, but -- I suppose if you really want to hear it just , I'll try to keep it tame. Well, I guess one of the big things is that they've cut hours at work again. They've basically been cutting them for, like, the better part of the year now. I mean, at first it was, you know, started out 40 and then it was down to, like, thirty eight. I remember complaining when it was thirty eight. I'm like, Dude, thirty eight.  What's the big difference? But it was thirty eight. I guess that made a big difference to me, well. Try fourteen, okay? Then come back to me and complain about your thirty eight hours, seriously. Fourteen, that's how many hours I had last week. Ooh, there's a fart; that's all I can say about that. You know, it's -- you know, and I don't like complaining about this kind of stuff on line because people see it and all. You know, and this -- it's not like this is something that anyone actually in the store can do anything about, so I guess I feel a little more comfortable knowing that I can, you know, leave them with that knowledge that I don't blame them for it, or anything like that. It's just that, you know, with the bad economy right now, and pretty basically everyone's in the shitter because of it. It's not just me. There's as lot of people suffering.We actually had one person who quit two days ago. I -- I didn't think she was going to. I couldn't believe she did. She was, like, one of the last persons I thought was going to quit in there. Or she was one of the last people. Did I say persons? Oh my God. I really am . Yeah, I didn't expect her to be the next one to quit. I did not see that coming at all. But she -- she'd been there, like, longer than I have, and -- but -- but I can't say I blame her, and apparently a lot of people said the same thing, they don't blame her either. Uh, she was a full time worker, basically being scheduled for fifteen hours a week. Now, I -- I was dropped to part time in July, so it's understandable in my case, to some extent. But, jeez, full time; Fifteen hours a week -- next thing you know, the bills are coming in and you can't pay 'em. And it's like, Uh oh. Uh oh, Spaghetti O.  Whatcha gonna do?So I'm thinking I might have to start looking for a second job pretty soon, because I'm in a pretty bad spot right now. I was supposed to put new tires on the car this month and I'm not going to be able to do that now, so. And that's bad, because I bought the car in two thousand and four and I haven't changed the tires on it since I bought it. So these tires are five years old now. I'm driving in snow, that's real great. And then I have this other thing, where I'm trying to make a Machinima, which is basically, for those who don't know, it's basically, like, you take a video game -- you take video game footage and add dialogue to it that doesn't belong there.Holy crap. What was that? Uh, anyway. You take video game footage and you add dialogue that doesn't belong there to make it funny. And that's basically Machinima. Video game footage; it's a movie made out of video game footage. Usually comedy, sometimes, something else. Anyway, so I'm trying to make one out of Super Smash Brothers Brawl, but I have two big problems. Number one is that I -- well, actually I have three problems. Number one is that I don't actually own my own copy of Brawl, so I've been renting one from the family video store. Number two is that the two characters I need to make my Machinima with, I haven't unlocked them yet, because it takes like freaking twenty hours of game play to do that, and it's just too depressing for me to sit there all that time. But if it takes twenty hours just to get to the point where I can start on making the video, then the number three problem is I'm trying to get rid of the damage gage at the bottom of the screen, what's just kind of a minor detail that I -- I don't know if everybody does it, but apparently you have to hack your Wii to do it. I don't know if I really want to do that, since I run the risk of just disabling it altogether.So I might just have to, like, come up with a different idea. It's just that I had this really good idea that I been thinking about for the last week, and I wanted to do it, and I been -- I even told the Machinima people about it, and they said they liked it. So -- so I'm just trying to make the video, and I can't freaking do it. Like I have all the voice acting ready to go, the script is ready to go, I just don't have the video game footage. So, I don't know what to do.Otherwise, I guess there's not a whole lot. It's a nice Halloween, actually. I'm probably going to sleep through it. Ahh. I -- I could look around and see if there's a party to go to or something, I don't know. I just -- one year ago tonight, actually, was our Halloween party. Dad hosted for Karaoke. It was one year ago tonight that we found out my Dad had cancer. And, uh, so that's kinda, you know, that's depressing too. But, at the same time, I almost can't help but feel proud of him for having survived it for a year. I mean, how many people can say that they survived cancer for a year? Most people find out they have it, you never know how long they got. So. I know my Dad's always been a fighter. I mean, he was in the army, so I know that he's better than this and he's gonna kick it. It's all just a matter of time, really.But, in the meantime, I just wish I could do more to help him, I mean, shit, I don't know. Holy shit. Wait; what? Oh, that's me. I'm in here. Oh my God, I'm in the phonebook. Jeez, I didn't know that. Yeah, okay. There's actually eight Bishops in this city. I had no idea there was that many Bishops. Oh, man. Okay, well now that starts to make me -- I thought Bishop was like a rare last name or something. I'm sitting here wondering, 'cause I have, like, a poster at work of my Dad, Mickey Bishop, you know, who's up, you know, with the cancer benefit thing. And, like -- like I still think that even with that poster hanging in there for a month, nobody even knows that my Dad's got cancer, 'cause I've never told anybody besides the HR lady. You know, and I use that as, like, an excuse, because I had -- I was tardy for work that day and she wanted to know why. And I said because that was the day I found out my Dad had cancer, and I just wasn't all here. And she was totally understanding about it. But as far as he had, I sure as hell got no right to complain about my life, I'll tell you that. I should be able to get my shit together here, go to Wal Mart, put in an application, do something -- just, you know, do something now while I still can, 'cause I -- you know, I'm still alive and I'm still kicking and I'm doing pretty successful on Nintendo Capri Sun, in fact . You know -- you know this might sound bad, but I actually think that the stuff I'm doing on Nintendo Capri Sun is probably the most successful thing I've ever done in my life. And I know most people say, Well, you're thirty three years old and you play video games. You're a loser.  Yeah, just go do your butt flexes, you know. Yeah, would you rather me go exercise? Would that be more interesting?You know the most hilarious thing about it is, that the only people you ever see out running are the ones that don't need to, you know, the ones who are already in shape, the ones that have a good enough metabolism that they don't have to waste their time on it yet they do anyway. You know, the ones that just run in your face and say, Hey,  you know, look at me. Look what I can do.  It's like, Yeah, well it's easy for you because it's not physically painful, you know, like it is for someone like me with two hundred and thirty pounds.  Can you imagine what that feels like, two hundred and thirty pounds of weight slamming down on the sole of your feet, you know, once every ten seconds? Huh. If you were laying down when somebody was doing that, I guaran -- fucking -- tee you it would hurt like hell. I guarantee you. And yet, when you're running, no, it shouldn't hurt at all. It should feel good. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. You can't even explain how. You can't even explain how. Uh huh. Uh huh. Yes, I'm being sarcastic, even though, honestly, I really don't know what the explanation is. I don't know what the jive answer is to that one. Okay, so I will see you guys next time. Uh, let's play . Oops, I did it again. See ya.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG3","Hey there, if you are watching this movie you probably all ready know what Circle Lens are. For those of you that don't I will just let you know really quick. Um, Circle Lens is a type of contact lens, um, that make your iris appear larger. So they're really good for cross playing or giving a dolly effect. They also help with helping make somebody look, like, more awake.And, um, they're colored lens usually. They come in, like, black, brown, but like, green, blue, all different colors. They're really good for people who have dark eyes because they're made -- usually they're made in Korea or Japan and, um, they're made so the colors will show very vibrantly on dark eyes.Right now I'm actually wearing a pair of Circle Lens. I'm wearing the Geo Nudy in violet. Um, they probably don't look that great because the light's not that great.Anyway, um, the point of this video is to let you guys know about a website that sells the Geo Brand Circle Lens for a really good price. Um, the website is called geocirclelens. web. com and all of the lenses on the site range from sixteen dollars to eighteen dollars. The is only five dollars so that is really good.The, um, girl who runs the site also does a bunch of promotions. Like, if you buy five pairs you get one free but you don't have to buy them all in one purchase, she will keep track of them for you. Um, she caries different kinds, she does back orders and she also carries in stock lenses so those will get to you within two to five days.Um, she carries the Nudy, the Angel, The Magic, the Piercing, any kind of lens that you might need. Um, also she responds to e mails really quickly, so, I'll put a link for the website and her e mail in the sidebar.Um, so if you have any more questions just ask her. All right, bye. I thought you're giving me cue, oh, wow, hey there. I just -- whatever we'll just keep going, Circle lens -Are you still recording? What it means to know. Aooo aweee abumbaway -Is it recording?Yeah.Oh.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG30","﻿Hi. Today was so awesome aside from the rain. England -- people from America, seriously, listen to me. Don't come to England if you don't like rain.Where am I in my bedroom which is kind of like a box. I live in a cardboard box. It's pretty fun.Of how -- how me and Sophie were in town and she made a whole list -- I remember 'cause she was telling me like, 20 times in a row. She needed some nail stuff, I would say yeah, okay. Then she needed some knit gloves, then she needed trousers, then she needed hand sanitizer.Everyone is out there buying them like -- so they're buying them, just because they're scared of swine flu. Swine flu is basically another bird flu and how many people -- only a couple of people died from bird flu, right? So, it's the same kinda thing, but with pigs. Which I don't get. It's a load of bullshit.She went and bought one and she was, like, I don't know what one to get, I really seriously don't. I'm like, just get a freaking one. She's like, no I don't want one that smells like alcohol. I'm like, if it has alcohol in it, let me drink it, 'cause that would be cool. That is my new dare. I will get hand sanitizer and drink it, even though I might be puking.Anyways, so like, so we find like, a whole rack of them. There was like, yellow ones, green ones, blue ones, and white ones. And they hand like, four different colors.I cut my finger today. Oh my God, that one has a penguin on it, okay? I was like, penguins, I love penguins. Who doesn't? They're so cute and adorable. I could just pick one up and eat one. Like, oh, I'll pick up that one.Then she picked up a dolphin one, just like they have like, little pictures on them. Like, what's wrong with dolphins? I'm like -not animals. Animals do it for, like, the circle -- the circle of life, I was like, yeah, just don't buy it. She was, like, fair point. I'm not going to buy it, hand sanitizer with, like, a shaggy thing on it. It's like putting some -- it's like putting a human on hand sanitizers with a ball, so it makes it even worse, so that the dog thing looks like a penis and the ball looks like balls, so it's like -- it's like penis about hand sanitizers.Wow , but that was pretty funny, that was a pretty fun day. Getting soaking wet and walking home and then I found my mum and then she gave me a bus fare home.So therefore your hands smell like sanitizer smells like, that would be pretty cool. If you actually have one, let me know what it actually smells like, 'cause I actually want to, like, try them and if I find the right one, I would drink it, I would drink that God damn sanitizer.","High","High","High"

"VLOG301","Hi everyone, I like vlogging with the web cam. It's quite strange because, I don't know, it's very surreal. I'm actually staring at myself while I speak. And I can't help but wonder, well who else makes these strange faces, for instance, while I speak. Hmm, I suppose I do. Anyway, I'm just back from presenting XXXX, and then David took a picture of me; just like, just like the new logo. Yay! So you can see that now.If you've been watching some of my vlogs before, I probably did talk about different internet sites, and Dick Campbell is one of them that I came across. I didn't actually have fun converted to that and become addicted. But Farm Town might be another one. My mother's addicted to that, but I'm not fully converted to that yet. And I have to say, though, that I am a huge Twist, and I have been for a while. I actually went to um, the Twist in August here, and The Sycamore Club, and if you're on Twitter you can follow me at It's pretty easy to remember.So, why am I writing today? Well, I was wearing pink tights. I don't have a full length mirror unless that sometimes happens, but I love my t shirt. My aunt got it for me in Australia. It's very punny and a good pun is always good. And I often go to a film festival on Thursday until next Monday. I've never been, which is quite shocking. Yes, I've never been. But I can't wait to go to I've signed up for the master class on Saturday, so it should be great fun. I'll talk to you all again, next Monday night and I'll tell you know how I got on.

"VLOG304","For this year's project for awesome I've chosen to talk about Tom's shoes. Tom's Shoe's is a shoe company that employs a one for one philosophy. For one pair of shoes you buy, they donate one pair of shoes to a child in need. One for one. Tom's has made drops in South Africa, Argentina, Ethiopia and even in America and altogether they've donated over a hundred and fifty thousand shoes to kids that don't have them. They're really comfortable, they're made of cloth so once you break them in, they're your shoes and they fit really well on your feet. They have really thick, good soles. The shoes that you get are the same shoes that the kids get so if you order a pair of Tom's and you're happy with the quality of the shoes, then what you're wearing on your feet is what a kid, who didn't have shoes before, will be wearing on their feet. They come in lots of cool styles. They have glitter shoes. They have rap boots now. They have lace up shoes if you don't like the slip on ones. If you interested in learning more about Tom's, there's a link in the side bar, check out and happy project for awesome .","Low","High","High"

Now what I mean is I want to use that wig and create a character. Now, I want you guys to help me out in creating the character. Which is the character that you like?

"VLOG306","﻿Hey. This is XXXX withXXXX and I am kind of quiet because it's late at night, and I'm putting together a couple of things before I wrap things up for the night.One of them being, I am signed on to TMottGoGo website, which is a really cool website. It's www. tmottgogo. com. Anyway, I've gone there to um, donate to that website. The creator and the manager of the website is a very cool person. So, I wanna make sure that that website is kept up and running because it certainly doesn't run on well wishes. So I'm doing my part and I'm donating a little. So, I recommend you do the same, if you know what I mean. It certainly would help things run smoothly.So, I'm working on that, and I guess I want to talk to you about something that I discovered last few days. Um, I went -- let's see when was it? On Tuesday, which was two days ago, I took a uh, sort of a lesson. Something that was very challenging for me, and I took this lesson, and this is something I was really nervous about. It's the type of thing where you -- you dream about it the night before because you're very concerned and you are worried about it, and um, anyway. So, this person was a huge help to me and teaching and guiding me and taking time with me, and I'm so very, very thankful.Now afterwards, I guess the custom, perhaps, might have been to tip this person. And this person said, listen, the best thing you can do for me is to write a thank you note. And I thought, well sure, of course I'll write a thank you note. And he said, yeah, because my supervisors, you know, the people that -- that I manage or the people that I work with, really know that kind of job I do, but my supervisors really may not know.So, this was, you know, the thing I could do to help him along so that he could make the advancements that he might need to make in his career and I was like, sure. You know, I felt so grateful for him helping me.Okay, well the thing that I didn't expect to happen was that, not only did I feel grateful for this wonderful, um, thing that happened. But um, just, like, donating to the um, TMottGoGo site to keep that up and running makes me feel very good, writing this thank you note, simple act to do, didn't take a lot of time, really didn't, like, you know, kill me to do it, obviously, uh, you know, felt very good to show my appreciation for somebody in this way. And to know that it would help their career.Um, anybody that shows that kind of commitment and care uh, to what they're working on, I think deserves huge, huge props. And I say props in that they -- they -- they -- why not give somebody like that extra encouragement, extra help? I know I appreciate when somebody says thank you to me. I save all my notes. When somebody gives me encouragement, I mean the smallest little nugget, I definitely appreciate. So it felt good to say thank you.So I encourage you to do that. I encourage everybody to continue to encourage others. Saying thank you goes a long way. Writing thank you goes a long way. Donating what we can to lend a helping hand to other folks usually reaps rewards beyond your imagination.So, if you can um, try donating to TMottGoGo. Uh, try writing a thank you note. Try a couple of those things. I guarantee you it's gonna feel really good.And I think I'll wrap up what I'm working on tonight and sign off and I'll see you around.Maybe next week, I'll have some photographs or paintings to show because I've certainly been working.All right, bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG307","Hey. It's me, XXXX. Um, coming to you today. First we showered. Had a big company softball tourney today. Very interesting. Basically, caked bouteay , you know. Um, three games, won two, lost one. But, uh, I didn't suck that much.Um, what the hell is up with team spirit? Team spirit. Co eds -- what do we know -- what am I doing? Rabble, rabble, rabble . Team spirit. What is that? Um, when you're supposed to be nice to the other team. What is that called? Sportsmanship. Where the hell has sportsmanship gone these days? Ah.We were at a company softball tournament, right? And this one team accusing us of cheating. Us of cheating in the softball slow pitch, right? Right. P. S. Slow pitch sucks. This little squatty, squatty five foot, four foot, nothing something or other, curly q hair guy, he starts talking smack . It's a game. It's a -- the -- the winner's got a trophy, just a huge trophy. It's like, where the hell am I gonna put a huge trophy? I don't want the f'ing trophy, you know? But apparently he really wanted it. Probably the only thing he'll ever win in his life. True. Not really sad. Very true.You know, when you -- uh -- when somebody is talking to you and they say something rude and you -- and you know -- like you -- you think about it and you're like, hey, hey, I should have something clever to say about that, something. And you're inside your head and it's going and then you're like, oh my gosh, has too much time gone past? Do I still have -- do I still have -- is there still time to retort? And, uh, you're -- you're sitting there, standing, laying, whatever you're doing when somebody says something. I mean do you -- that you -- you should say something mean back, too, or at least something clever? I mean, redeem yourself or -- you just don't let them win at all costs. Never back down. Never say die.So, uh, that happened to me actually a couple times today. I don't know what it was. Maybe it was the sun or maybe it was the Long Island I drank before the game. This mo fo said me things numerous times and every single time -- every single time I couldn't think of anything to say to him. Until later, you know. You know, when somebody says something mean. You guys just a bunch of cheaters. You couldn't win a game to save your life. And then you come back at them with, yeah, well you're short, you're -- you're face is a cheater. Uh.And you really wish you would have said, oh my gosh, why are you even talking to me? You're voice gives me a headache. Who are you? Your balls reek and I can smell them from here. Your mother's a whore.But you didn't. And you always think about the responses or your clever comebacks like way too late 'til where you can't even come back. Like sometimes even years. And you're like calling up them on the phone and be like, hey Stacy remember that one time you called me a whore? Well I did your boyfriend so who's the whore now? But it never really has the same effect.So that little man got the best of me today and I'm gonna have to go on with the rest of my life always knowing that. Maybe it's a sign that I should focus more on the game and a little less on the party. Come on. Right. Purple . Purple nurple a. k. a. loser, curly q. I got the best of you.

"VLOG31","Hey guys, it's Wednesday so I thought I would just do a quick, uh, bloggedy blog and kinda do like a little thing, um, but basically I was trying to think of different video ideas and I came up with one that I think could be uh, kinda fun.Um, so I moved to Chicago in June, right? But I never really have any time to go exploring throughout the city, feel like I don't really know this place very well yet, so I thought that I could do like a scavenger hunt and you guys could name off a bunch of shit that you either want me to find or go do or whatever and then I gotta take my video camera and go around the city and find all this shit.Um, so I think it could be really fun, so I definitely want you guys to list some shit for me to find. But uh, things that I will not find no matter how much you beg of me. First being, drugs. I'm not gonna go find any drugs of any kind, so don't even bother begging. Also that includes drug dealers. I don't have any interest in meeting up with any drug dealers as well as for prostitutes. I don't have any interest in finding any prostitutes at all.So yeah, so I'm gonna take a friend with me and we're going to do around the city and do that. I want to do it before Christmas, though, so just name some shit as soon as you can, I guess.Um, in the meantime, rest of my day today I'm gonna clean the fucking room 'cause it's a mess, and then I'm going to do a Heliopsis photo shoot tonight uh, for those of you who don't know, it's my brother and his uh, friend Michelle , it's their etsy store, so that could be kinda fun.Um, so yeah, so name a buncha shit, then I'll go around the city, it'll be fun and yeah, I hope you guys are having a fantastic day and I will see you guys later.Bye.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG310","Hey everyone, how's it going? I hope this video finds you well. Last week I recorded a video and as I was editing through it, I realized that it was more of a series than one simple little video and so I was going to set up a big series little thing that I had a really clever name for, but I completely forget what the -- the name of it is gonna be and realize that it's gonna take a little while to edit and so I did another video in the interim and then figured I'll get back to the other video that I recorded last week before this going to be turning into the series with clever name.Anyways, it doesn't really matter because of the fact that I have to do this rant right now, which, if I ever get through the series and to the series and present the series to you, then you will really really appreciate this rant because you have no idea -- and it's -- I mean it's not big -- well, it's big to me, okay? So other people would just kinda probably sit back and laugh, but right now I'm like, ooh, I have to do a rant, I have to do a rant, I have to do a rant or else my head's going to explode.A couple of weeks ago I spent two days at my father's house, setting up his DSL. Actually it was cable. He already had cable but he still had dial up and so we had to switch the dial up. And of course when you had to, to switch it, they didn't just let you get the, the -- you know, he was like he already has cable, so that would be cool if you could just put your phone and cable and make those little bundles, you know, those little bundles. But you had to upgrade the bundles in order to use the bundles.He had cable, but in order to get the bundle which had the high speed internet, he had to upgrade his cable to digital cable. And he had to upgrade his phone, his regular phone, to digital phone.Okay, now, the digital cable turned into, he had to get a box and he had to do all this other stuff -- my father is like seventy something years old. And he was pretty much -- you know what, I really like what you -- I had before. Is there any way that I can keep it? And basically the company was like, no actually you can't because if you actually keep it, you'll have to pay more. I'm sorry, did you just say I have to pay more for a lesser service? Um, excuse me? Yeah.So basically what you're telling me is that I can't just enjoy your service right now, I have to have more, and more, and more. So I have to have those little additional features or else I'm screwed? Better and better, and better and, fancier things, and fancier things and more, which is great for a seventy something year old, you know, because they don't need to have the stuff that they enjoy. They have to have digital cable, because you know, their eyes really tell the difference between regular cable and digital cable.Oh, and digital phone. That's a brilliant idea. More, and did you know what? Did you know that if you have digital phone, better, and power goes out, you can't call nine one one? More and better, isn't that fantastic?I learned in California when the power went out, we had all these blackouts -- these rolling blackouts, because we were being screwed by some power company, that when power goes out, you can't use a cordless phone, because it needs power in order to be used.But I still had a landline phone so I was the only person in my apartment complex that could call anybody and so I had lines out my apartment for people who needed to call people because I was the only one that actually had the working phone. And it's so great to know, the fact that my seventy something year old father now cannot call nine one one, because you know, nine one one is less likely to be used when there's some major catastrophe that may result in power going out for extended periods of time. And seventy something years old are you know, less likely to trip and fall when they're walking around in the dark.But the main point, this main point that has just been the straw that's broken this little camel's back is that I spent two days, two full days over there, setting up his email with the, the, the new -- 'cause I had to upgrade -- he had dial up so I had to upgrade his email as well as the, the, the internet access.So the internet access set up was great, no problem, but of course my seventy something year old father, who, who, when you get to that age, change is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- wants to use the same email program that he has been using for the past decade.Understandable, it takes him two years to get used to a program so he wants to use the same program and this program is so ancient that if it were a person, it would be like uh -- somebody that was in their prime in nineteen eighty three who is still trying to be that cool teenager, that just ends up looking like a moron, with big useless hair and ugly shoes.And after those two days -- two days, two days of doing this, I get him all set up, it was working beautifully. Well, I just found out, no more than ten minutes ago that my father, having a minor problem, called up customer service. Two days of forcing that program into a two thousand and nine bubble, all lost, lost, bye bye, all lost, in thirty seconds.Lost, by some girl, not knowing what the bleep she's doing, but can't admit that, she's too lazy and not paid enough to really care -- well she decided to have my father erase all of the accounts and use the wizard. Wow. Aren't you brilliant? Aww, use the wizard? I wouldn't of thought to try that.And oh, if I did think of trying to use the wizard and it worked, I think I would've said, ah, I rather set up everything manually. What's the fun in using the automatic wizard? When I can go through it manually, step by step, port by port, POP three by POP three until my brain melts and oozes down the back of my throat searing multiple holes through by stomach and leaks out my bellybutton, like flesh eating bacteria which then engulfs me like some geriatric cyberspace black hole on hemorrhoids. Woohoo, hemorrhoids, wow.And I can just see this girl, this Julie, Julie, Julie, Julie, Julie, whom, for some reason I picture as chewing bubble gum with newly manicured tacky fingernails shoved so far up her bum you can file them through her nose. Julie, not realizing that she is disintegrating the life span of some stranger by fifty years. Just like a drug pusher preying on innocent souls.No, it's okay, go ahead, delete it, it won't hurt anything, just delete all the accounts. It's okay. Oh Julie, how could you do this to me? And of course, she's doing this all with a giggle and a perky, sweet, sweet smile. Perkily concluding, well, I can't seem to fix your problem today, sir, you'll have to contact your system administrator. Is there anything else I can do for you today?You have no idea. Well, Julie, Julie, Julie, come to think of it, there is -- do you think I could get a lobotomy or is that considered an upgrade? .Oh, hey pumpkin you're -- aww, you are so fired.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG311","-- and continues to be popular today. And if you wanna know why he's called Uncle Milton -- that's actually the, uh, real name that he goes by now -- it's because this is a bad joke, so don't blame me, but he says that he was in charge of all the ants, so then he must be the uncle. All right. I was coming to, um, a second question and that would be from Adwena in Edmonton. And she asks, um, I heard that when you buy an ant farm it doesn't come with the ants, that you have to get them later?  Well, that's true, but you know what? You don't have to get the ants yourself. You can actually send away for them. I believe all ant farms come with a certificate that you send in the mail, and then a few weeks later you get a plastic vile of about 30 ants. Now, if you want to know where those ants come from, there's actual jobs -- uh, careers, if you will -- of people who are calling themselves ant catchers. And they pay about a little bit over a penny or a cent, or, depending on what country you're from, maybe a couple of pesos -- I'm not too sure -- uh, for an ant. And it takes about ten hours to gather fifty thousand ants. So if that a career you want to get into, contact Uncle Milton, 'cause, uh, maybe he could get you a job in ants. I guess that would be ant ranching. Ant harvesting? I don't know, but there is a job out there for you if you want it.All right, last question is from, uh, Francis in Fort Collins, Colorado, and he asks, Why would anyone be interested in ant farms?  Well, obviously a lot of people are interested in ant farms, Francis, or else it wouldn't be a really popular toy. But I don't want a philosophical point of view on this. You remember that little show called Survivor that was real famous? Popular? I'm sure you watched it, Francis. That -- that's your answer. All right? . We have our own little TV shows that could be metaphorical ant farms, when you think about it. Like, all those reality based shows are pretty much just human ant farms, don't you think? All right. Think about that one for a while.That's it for XXXX this week. Go ahead and e mail me your suggestions, questions or thoughts. Maybe you'd like to send in a photo of your own ant gallery, your ants' farm or your aunts and uncles -- who knows? Go ahead and send them my way and, uh, I'll be really appreciative. And, who knows; maybe I'll get an ant farm myself.﻿And welcome to XXXX, this is something we do every week on web waste world. We pick a topic, answer your question on that topic and you're so much smarter for it that you thank us in your will. All right, so the topic is on ant farms. Let's go ahead and get into the first question from Patsy in Plainfield, Connecticut and she asks who invented ant farms and why? Good question. Not a lot of people know the answer to this but I found out and of course, it's the guy named Milton Levine. Nineteen fifties, he was a distributer of, ah, novelties gag items including spud guns and rubber shrunken heads. And he wanted to actually widen his merchandise and all of the sudden he came up with this great idea. In nineteen fifty six, he went to a picnic with his family and noticed how little kids love to put ants in Mason jars with dirt and then watch them dig tunnels and sure enough he decided -","Low","High","High"

And today is technically my birthday - it's after midnight and it is June twenty fourth, so happy birthday. I am twenty seven today and tomorrow at six in the morning, I am flying up to Boston and that's pretty exciting. I have been in Florida for about three months now.

My friend Jake has arrived and he's been keeping me company for my birthday, so that has been wonderful. So that's it for my blog update. No one has given me a dare yet, so I won't be doing one this blog. However, I have been told to, ah, punish Pam for taking so long to do her last dare. Unfortunately, I couldn't really think of a punishment that wouldn't involve you running around naked, so instead I am just going to give you another dare to do since it is not your turn, so now you are going to have to do two dares in a short amount of time which is sort of like a punishment. So Pam, your dare -- ah, I am actually going to give you a choice of two and which ever one you don't do I think I am going to have Molly do the other one. You can either make a music video -- just do something poppy -- do something that we would not expect from you that would be hilarious. That's your dare. Or since I know that you were recently in a show where you had to play a Ukrainian cooking show host or something owhat you were. Ah, I would like you to prepare a dish and show us how to do it. I want you to put a little cooking show together, but I want it an actual working recipe so that when you make it everyone else can, you know, know how to do it. So, this is going to be my final one from Florida, ah, from the garage, how glamorous, I know. Ah, that's it.

Today me and my sisters and my mum, we had to go shopping to get some stuff because my sisters are going on tour. So we went into the dollar store, right? And I didn't have anything that I needed or anything, so I was just kind of looking on. I didn't -- I had nothing to do. And you know how it goes, stores are usually kind of dinky and boring, both things really cool, right? So I'm wandering around and wandering around and suddenly I see this like, section of the wall that's covered in super hero coloring books. Of course that gets my attention. I mean, who wouldn't wanna go look at that, really. Anyway, so I go over there and I'm looking and I'm seeing you know, Spiderman, Captain America, some Iron Man, I don't know who he is. I gotta whole -- and then I saw the greatest super hero of all time. Batman. And he has like three different kinds of coloring book. One of them was actually like waterpaint -- like watercolor paint. But that one was kind of boring. And then there was this other one that was like the jumbo Batman coloring book and I was like, oh my gosh. I started looking through it and I saw this page of stickers and I'm like oh, Batman stickers, oh my gosh. And eventually I pull myself away and we shopped a little more, and I come back to the coloring book section and there was one other coloring book and it had like these two little, like -- it was stuck like this and it opened up there about that big but like that long. And so anyway, then they have stickers on them, the same stickers as in the other coloring books, but I didn't know that. And then, feeling rough and leaving everything and I went over to their coloring book section and I sit there staring at it and staring and -- and my sister comes over and I'm like, great, I totally want to steal this sticker. And she's like, do it, I'll cover you. And she stands at my side and I turned to her. I'm like, so which one -- which one should I -- should I take 'cause I'm gonna put it on the back of my phone. And she's like, hmm. I saw this really awesome one and it was like, you know, the Batman sign and then under it says Batman begins. Um, and I was like well, it's too big, it will cover up my camera on my phone. And she's like, well, we'll think it out, well. So we're trying to pick out a smaller one and I finally picked out one that I inspected on my phone and my other sister Cynthia comes over. Well she was in my other videos. Anyway she comes over and she was like, What you doing in there? 'Cause she saw my phone and everything and she's like, oh, and she starts making a huge deal of it and I'm like -- and I like started feeling really bad. And so like, roll us out of there, right? And I'm like, I'm gonna get away with this sticker. I'm gonna get away with it. And like, she was like, shame, shame on your name. You are a stealer. You're a thief. You are stealing a sticker. A sticker. How dare you steal a sticker?And I was sitting there and my -- my mood of stealing stickers suddenly started going down and down and down. And I started feeling really bad about it and so then I asked my mum for a dollar and I got the coloring book. And now I can check whatever out --- whatever I want out of the family of stickers-- there's one sticker. That wasn't the original sticker that I stuck on there but I changed it 'cause it looks awesomer and it also tripped up my ipod with Batman stickers. There is the one that we wanted on there but it was too big. Anyway.It was a pretty exciting day. Stealing stickers and actually borrowing mum. Yeah. I just ate and it was tasty. Batman. I just want to let you know that from my Batman coloring book, I did color a picture and here it is.","High","Low","High"

"VLOG315","Okay everyone. Um, so today I came across a lot of videos that said Project for Awesome and I was wandering what that was. And, so today it's December seventeenth. Um, YouTube gathers, eh, itself I guess to make videos about different charities and to try to get some money to those different charities. Um, I think it's an amazing, amazing opportunity. I cannot believe what a YouTube has done with that. Um, I was looking at Megan Tonya's video and I was amazed by it and by all the meaning of it. Um, then I looked at makeup by Raisa's video, then I looked at, um, Elissa Nova's video. There were a lot of videos out there talking about different charities.And, um, I know I have eight subscribers but I don't care. I think this is a really good cause. So, even if it is only eight people, I want you to know about these. So, the charity that I'm going to talk about is Team Hoyt. Um, what Team Hoyt pretty much is, is a story that makes me cry a lot. Um, so you have the whole story in www dot TeamHoyt -- Hoyt like H O-Y T. com. Um, the thing is Rick, which is the son -- there's the father and son that's the team. Rick was diagnosed as sick quadriplegic with cerebral palsy. So, pretty much what I have read of the story, he could not communicate himself until he was eighteen. And then um, they made, um, ah -- oh yeah -- this is really stupid. Um, The university made a computer for him for communicating with his family. When he was thirteen he could finally go to the public school. Then he went to Boston College -- Boston University, sorry, and etcetera.So, in the Spring of nineteen seventy seven, Rick told his father that he wanted to participate in a five mile benefit run from a lacrosse player who had been paralyzed in an accident. Far from being a long distant runner, Dick which is his dad, agreed to push Rick in his wheelchair and they finished all five miles, coming in next to last.So -- oh, God. So, they kept running and -- I think up to today, the two thousand and nine Boston Marathon was officially Team Hoyt's thousandth race. Rick always says that if comes down to doing one race a year, he would like it to be the Boston Marathon, his favorite race. Dick Hoyt hopes that he is able to push Rick in the next Boston Marathon when he is seventy years old.God -- so, what this Foundation does -- um, it's a non profit organization that was formed in nineteen eighty nine. I am reading it; I do not know it -- but -- like memory. So, it aspires to building individual character, self confidence and self esteem of America's disabled young people for inclusion in all facets of daily life including in family and community activities and specialist sports at home, in the schools and in the workplace. And as I told you before, um, he couldn't go to a school until he was thirteen. So, it's kind of a sad story and -- it ended up really well. I guess and, you know, seeing -- ach, it's just so amazing. So, I'm going to put a link on the side bar to Team Hoyt's, um, website and I'm also gonna put the link to where you can donate.I know it's, like, hard times right now, but even if it's just a couple of dollars if you're able to donate then, then just do it. Um, I think you can do it through Paypal and by check. So, yeah, and you can pretty much, um, you know, gather a little more information about it. And yeah, so please support this video, please rate it and comment. Because all they wanna do is put, um, this project for Awesome videos up into YouTube for forty eight hours and -- ah, please go to other Projects for Awesome videos and rate them and comment on them because this is a really, really good cause. And yeah, um, check out Team Hoyt please. I guess it's as I said an amazing charity and an amazing story. And that was it, thank you so much guys, bye.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG317","So as you can tell I'm back from my trip to California and let me tell you, it was one of the best summers I've had in a really long time. So before starting this video let me tell you that I did not get that much footage of me being in California because I was just basking in the awe of all these amazing people I met. Anyways if you can't tell the difference off the bat, I am pretty dark -- I got uh, a tan line from where my glasses were, and yeah, look at that -- pretty bad, uh, farmers' tan. Yeah so my flight to get to California was at six forty five a. m. I got to the airport and I flew from my city and then I had a connection flight in Atlanta, and while I was on the plane going to California, I was sitting in the window seat and there was two other women sitting next to me. One was like a middle aged woman and one was uh -- like a kind of, let's say, uh -- uh -- a fluffy woman. So I was sitting there, and an hour -- an hour and a half left of the flight, I needed to use the restroom, and both of the women were sleeping, and I didn't want to say, Hey you fat girl, get up, I need to use the restroom. No, because that would be really rude. So I held my pee in -- it probably wasn't the best thing for my liver, whatever that affects your body but um, that was my flight experience, yeah. And during my stay there I met a lot of amazing people that I've been talking to online for a really long time, and to actually see their face was like so surreal -- I was like overwhelmed. Um, sorry if I leave your name out -- uh -- I'm trying to remember. I met XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. One day we decided, hey let's go hang out in the playground at the park. This is like the only footage that I have besides the one that I did with Christian -- the jumping video -- and if you guys haven't seen it, you could see it right here. There was this little, um, twisty thingy that you got on, and you spin and you spin and then you get off, and then it feels so -- I don't know. I -- I'm not really a fan of being dizzy, but everybody knows there actually how to do it, so um, roll the clip.Now, that was crazy and I was about to teach her an acoustic playlist and I heard so many amazing artists. And met a lot of cool people there and, ah, yeah, overall it was great, it was a fun night. Yeah, and I don't know how you guys, Southern Californians - I don't know if that's the right term -- like, stay in shape, like you guys have all of these delicious, ah, food restaurants and -- I don't even know how you guys contain that in that small, built -- anyways, um, I had a -- my first in and out and it was divine. And I had Yogurtland for the first time and it was amazing and I really wish that they had those kinds of foods here but they don't.Oh, and I had these Mexican burritos, um, it had meat, it had sour cream, it had fries. It was so good. So, as I mentioned about my previous video of me jumping with Christian. We went to this beach and we were recording and stuff and we were done and there kids were walking toward us. So, I was like, oh shoot. Then he grabbed my pen and -- sign your autograph. No, and these teens they were so obnoxious. They asked us all these questions and they were like, what is that-- what are you recording for? Is this going to be on YouTube? What's your YouTube name? If you are one of them and you are watching this video right now, um, you guys shouldn't be obnoxious. And there was this one girl that randomly decided, hey, I think that I'm going to lick XXXX's camera. And she fricking licked my lens and I'm like -Shh. Oh, and then I went to the and XXXX, but I'm the type of person that really doesn't like rollercoasters -- if you guys were there you would understand. I'm usually the guy that's back and watch people's stuff, but it was really fun. And I met Christine, Kevin, Wongfu Guys, Philip, Tad and Wes, and David, and Natalie, and Evendy my home girl, yeah. So, my California trip was definitely an experience that I won't forget and I definitely will be going there again sometime soon.Um, oh yeah, I'm in the process of moving my stuff to my new place, because school is starting soon -- ah, I don't even want to think about school. And, I recently reached over three thousand subscribers and I just want to say thanks for everyone for watching my videos and still thinking that they're semi entertaining. But, yeah, I just want to say thanks for watching and subscribing and rating and commenting and favoriting and all that shebang. I think that's it. Um, guys want to see my tan line again? Uh, it's ridiculous.","High","High","High"
"VLOG318","﻿Hi everybody, how you doing? It's XXXX from XXXX. Today in the Catholic Church was the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. What's the Immaculate Conception? Well, a lot of Catholics will mistakenly tell you that it was the conception of Jesus. I used to think that myself, but that's not true. That's a totally different event. That was the Annunciation. The Feast of the Immaculate Conception was the conception of our Blessed Mother into the womb of Saint Anne, her mother. Well, what was so immaculate about that, you might ask.Well, we're going to have to go back in time to Adam and Eve, the very first two people on Earth. Now, we all know the story. Adam and Eve they ate the fruit and they caused humanity to fall into sin, okay. So therefore, as punishment, every offspring of Eve and Adam would be born into sin. That includes you and I and all of our children and our children's children. Okay?So, we are all born in original sin. We have that on our souls that's why -- that's the purpose of Baptism to get rid of that sin. All right? Now, we believe that God spared our Lady of being born with original sin.﻿This is all of us. Pretend we're these soda cans, okay? Just imagine -- pretend that these are people, okay? And then this bowl here -Has a lot of popcorn in it.-- Uh, is sin, okay? When we're born, we fall into the -- we fall into the original sin. Okay. Can you hear that? These are -- this is us when we're -- our conceptions, okay? All of us -- all of us are into that -- are -- are born with that original sin, okay, all of us. Woo, woo, woo.Alright. Now, when it was Mary's turn, Jesus, being Mary's savior, did save her. He spared her into going into the original sin, from being born into the original sin. So yes, he is still her savior, it just worked a little bit differently, alright? Her -- she was born with -- she was born sinless, okay, thanks to Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit. Thanks to the Holy Trinity, okay. So Jesus is her savior. The rest of us were redeemed by Jesus after our births with Baptism, confession, and everything.Uh, if anyone's interested in seeing a movie about it, there's a great one I recommend. It's called, um, The Song of Bernadette. It's in black and white, but it's a beautiful, beautiful picture. Go to Blockbuster. Go to Hollywood Video. They all have it. Um, check the, uh, I guess the oldie movies or something like that. It was made in, like, I don't know, like, the fifties or sixties or something like that. It's black and white. But, um, beautiful picture and he explains it -- explains what the whole Our Lady of Lords and the Immaculate Conception is.Alright. I hope I didn't cause any more confusion with that. I tried to do my best. But thank you anyway, and have a great week.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG319","Hey, YouTube. Um, so I haven't been making a video for a very, very, very long time and, um, I just didn't feel like it and then this thing happened and well, nothing interesting happened actually or nothing that you guys should know, so yeah.Um, I think five and I can't remember how many times. Well, that was actually, um, an answer to a question, um, someone's, uh, screen name which I can't pronounce in English, which will be right here somewhere. Um, well his question was, with how many guys did you make out and with how many times with each guy? Well, um, yeah, nothing been going on and, um, I don't have any ideas anymore, so this kind of bad, and, um, yeah, I -- I just don't know what I should say actually.Um, today I went shopping and, um, I was with my mom which is kind of, I don't know, weird and, um, these two guys were walking past me and one just says, like Emo, and I'm like, why do you have to call me Emo? Just, um, 'cause I'm wearing, like that kind of clothes. I don't get it. So, yeah, I mean, my clothes aren't that Emo, it's all right though.Well, I was just like, 'cause I bought new clothes just like yesterday, so you just have to wear them immediately. That's -- that's what I have. When I buy new stuff I immediately want to wear it, straight away. I just want to wear it and it doesn't matter if it doesn't match. Well it does, actually, but have to wear 'em in the house or something; I just want to try them out, but, um, nothing has been going on.Do you notice that I turn my head around in that last bit? But whatever. Um, do you have any ideas you people should send me something or I don't know. Well I have thirty subscribers. Yeah, thirty and I'm pleased. I really like that, so yeah. Um, I'm just gonna, I don't know, surf on the internet.I wanna -- I wanna -- I have some new shoes which I'm really psyched about, so just have to show them, so, um, I'll be back in a sec, I won't be that long, okay? Bye.Okay, I'm back, and, um, while I was, um, running downstairs, um, to get my shoes I saw the ice cream man. I saw the ice cream man standing there, so got myself some ice cream. So now I'm going to be eating during this video.There. Um, I got these, which I'm really psyched about. There the shoelaces aren't supposed to go like this, but I just, I like it like this, so, yeah. A friend of mine has them and I really, really, really love them, so I bought them as well . I hope she doesn't mind.Um, yeah, I really don't have anything to talk about, so just going to, I don't know, eat this ice cream and speed it up.. Oh, oh. You're so good to me baby, baby.Oh my God, brain freeze.I want to lock you up in my closet, when no one's around. I wanna put your hand in my pocket, because you're allowed. I wanna drive you into the corner, and kiss you without a sound. I wanna stay this way forever, I'll say it loud. Now you're in, and you can't get out. You make me so hot.Well I haven't finished my ice cream yet, but I'm getting, like, a brain freeze and this is taking eleven minutes already, so, yeah, I think you guys probably getting bored anyway.Um, XXXX why did you delete your account, I was so -- I so aah!

"VLOG32","﻿Hey, what's up? This is XXXX. Um, it's been about three or four, maybe more months since I've done a video blog, and I figured I would do one. Um, I know if you watched my other videos. You'll notice that I got a different setting here. I got myself a house, so this is just my little computer area, uh, that I got set aside. So that door opens when my cats are out there and they meow constantly and I don't want my video being full of meow, meow, meow, meow.So I figured that I got a lot of hits and a lot of views and a lot of comments on my ITT Tech rant. So I figured I would do a follow up to that, and tell you guys what I'm doing and what I found out and everything. So apparently there is two types of accreditation, National and Regional. All your regular schools like University of Huston, University of Miami, you know, Cornhuskers, Sooners, all that. They're all regional. All the technical schools, ITT tech and stuff like that, they are all national. It doesn't seem like that would be right. It seems national would be more important, but that's not the way it is. Okay.So, I searched for -- high and low for a school, U of H told me up yours. You know, South West Texas State laughed and said you might as well just start as a freshman, live on campus. Uh, no. Okay, so my mother is a student currently at Kaplan University, as an online school, and I hear, I can hear the moans right now going eh, online school, no that's a rip off, it's crap. Let me tell you it's not. Kaplan is the real deal. Um, I am proud to announce that Kaplan accepted my degree from ITT Tech and I am now enrolled officially as a junior in undergraduate program at Kaplan Online University and I'm getting a Bachelor of Psychology studying Behavioral Analysis. Now I know that some of you are like, what? It gets worse, a minor in History.So here is the deal. I am going to be a high school teacher. I will wait for the shock to set in. I know what I look like. It's a curse. Okay, so I'm a be a high school teacher. When's the last time you had a spring break? Exactly. Okay. I actually do care though. It's real weird. I'm not really sure why I care. I haven't really come up with a reason, but I care. So, being a teacher sounds awesome. Besides all the holidays and the two months in the summer that you get off completely. Wow. Besides all that, it just sounds so fun. So, I want to teach either some sort of history or psychology class or sociology.So the way it works where I live, is you don't necessarily have to have a degree in what you teach, but you have to have twenty four credit hours minimum in that, you know, subject. So the way Kaplan works is the last six courses you take are electives and you pick from a list of like five hundred classes. I'm not even kidding. Like twelve accounting courses, everything from typewriting to HTML code, to pharmaceuticals, to law enforcement, to constitutional law. I might take that. Especially if I'm going to teach history, right? Right. Well, some of the courses I have to take for the psychology degree fall under the history category. I only need 24 hours in one subject, so that frees up some more electives. I also have to take physical science, which is kind of shocking to me. I also have to take statistics. I can't even say it. Statistics, there you go, statistics. I am so done.So, anyways, the point is I get credit for all this. In fact, Kaplan takes my ITT Tech so much that I'm actually don't have to take intro to physiology because I took it at ITT Tech. When I went to ITT, I had to take physics, one, two, three, and four, English composition, uh, you now, basic computer skills. I had to take sociology and psychology, and government and economics, it was really weird. But -- so they are giving me credit for all that. I'm a veteran. Kaplan has a department just for the military. My academic advisor has a degree, a Bachelor's in Psychology. Perfect.Uh, the price? Okay, the price is three hundred fifty five dollars per credit hour, but if you are a veteran, it's two forty. Books, all other fees, all -- everything is included in that price. I'll be done in eighteen months. Eighteen months I'll be a teacher, pretty much. I gotta take a teacher's certification course after that, but I'll deal with that when I'm done with my degree. But I'm telling you, I think you can just yahoo Kaplan. It's spelled with a K. K A-P L-A N. They didn't ask me to do a video, they didn't -- they don't even know I do video blogs or nothing. I'm telling you that this place is -- I know it's legit because my mom is going there. She has her degree, you know, um, I mean she's getting a master's from there.Everything is really cool, I mean you take two classes at a time. The last six of the whole school you get to pick from the list from whatever you want. They send you your books for free. If you have access to their Florida big huge public library, they'll actually mail you the actual books. I mean, it's just too good to be true. And let's say later I want to take this degree and go get my master's at like University of Huston, they are the exact same accreditation; they would absolutely be accepted. I mean, the school district, they told me that Kaplan University is on their list of places they accept. The school district told me that.So, I found my place, I'm a be a high school teacher. I don't really know if I, um, if it set in yet, but we'll see what happens, you know? Um, so anyways, I hope that this is informative. Uh, if you went to ITT, or you going there, or you've go -- or you're alumni, just check it out, Kaplan. If you are not happy with ITT Tech, and you are currently going there, I bet you -- if you call Kaplan, you can switch to the online, and whatever classes you've already taken at ITT will transfer over. I got out of Intro of Psychology because I took it at ITT. Anyways, I'm XXXX, look for much more in the future. And I'm gonna stop -- try to stop cursing so much, because if I'm a be a teacher, I can't say fuck. Alright, thanks for watching. Peace.","High","High","High"

Yeah, no.So, this week I was going to talk about of YouTube, but I can do that another time, because this week I made a really exciting discovery that I really wanna talk about. This discovery is Vitamin String Quartet, or because they are American Vitamin String Quartet. One of the things that makes them stand out is that fact that a usual string quartet has two violins, one viola and a cello, but they have two violas instead. I know, crazy right. Don't take my word for it because I'm not sure that's right. I think they changed stuff because I'm not sure it's the same people the whole time.The reason I find them so exciting is because first of all they do covers of pop music -- Paramour, mainly. That's the only real one I care about. And, I'm seeing them in a week, just in case you didn't know. And I can play one of the instruments in the quartet. Make sure it didn't happen. Nah, whoop whoop. So now, all we are waiting for is sheet music to become available because I know that they are working on that at the moment, I think. Again, don't trust me. Adudududuududddaa.

And I know that jellyfish are wildlife, but what do they make crabby patties out of? 'Cause they can't make it out of people?Is the reason that Mister Krabs keeps this a secret because he does not want people to find out what he does put in the crabby patties, because maybe, I dunno, it's illegal? Will we eventually find out that Mister Krabs is actually a serial killer that uses people from his community to feed his costumers? Does Sponge Bob just pretend to be young and naïve?

Um, anyway I started smelling something really funny and uh, it just hit me so I ran in there and there was the pot, glowing red, sinking into the stove, it welded itself to the stove.So, I had to get new appliances and therefore I decided while the appliances are out of the room, or I have them deliver them to the front room or something, I could have that floor done, which is half carpet, half linoleum, and we just found out by peeling it back, or from what we could tell, it was put in with the house and the house was built sixty years ago. Yeah, at least sixty years ago. The carpet's already disgusting in the kitchen -- well, it's disgusting anyway, sorta, but in the kitchen especially. I just can't -- well, anyway, so this was definitely well overdue.I'm gonna let you guys go. Have a happy Inauguration Day and uh, have a happy anything else that you guys might be happy for -- happy upcoming digital TV day or something, I think that's on my birthday. Well, yeah, cheers.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG325","Hello. Is this thing on? Hi, um, XXXX? You know, I was watching your video. I'm a big fan and I was sitting with my mom decorating these little ceramic texts that me and her make every day after church. And she was talking to me about those darn cremosexuals that you were talking to me about. And I -- Ithink that I have a very big -- a very big solution for you. Now, cremosexuals- -well we all know that the cramos-- the cramos are very bad and that, you know, that the God -- God doesn't like those kinds. You know that Elton John and the RuPaul? You know, they are just bad, bad men.Shush kitty, be quiet. You know, I love you kitty, I love you kitty. And you know we were talking, I know the gays -- the gays, they upset you with their -- with their -- with their big -- their big gotty glasses and the I'm still standing better than I ever did. Looking like a true survivor, feeling like I'm going to hell. But no, but no, I'm still standing after all this time, picking up the-- Anyway my point is you know, sometimes if you have to ask if someone's gay because if you don't, how will they know that it's wrong? How will they know that they're -- that they're bound for the hell fire?In my Evangelical Kentucky Church that I go to, we -- we sing this little hymn, and I know it's a hymn because my mommy told me. Okay, we sing, Oh amazing Grace likes boys but didn't have sex until marriage. When she had sex it was only with one guy. Grace only had sex one time, and it was only for procreation. Procreation is the only time you should have the sex scene, have the sex scene, have the sex scene time. Anyway, so I -- I really -- it's a big issue that a lot of people have to think about. You know, yeah, and I do understand your question but I don't understand the way that you like sinners. Because I mean God says hate the sinners hate the sin. You know, I've never -- I've never stolen anything. I've never lied to my parents. You know, I just don't understand the need for all that stuff, you know. But some people they just don't have the big one, they don't have the Jesus and they think -- I think that's wrong. Okay thanks Brocket, I am glad that you were touching on this issue because this is an issue I think of before I pray, before I go to bed. Because when I pray, I say, God, God, please help those darn sinners those darn homosexuals, those darn people who don't like this Sarah Palin, tell them that God, they're going to burn in hell. Well I'm going to say bye bye. I don't even know how to use this conflabbit thing. I think I'm just going to -- my brother Jim, he likes that hard rock, that uh -- that I don't give a damn about the reputation. That music, yeah yep, that's not good music uh uh. He watches that -- that Scrubs, yuck. Okay, I'm going to go now. Bye bye. Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye. You know that procreation is good, we know that gays they are bad just like the Harry Potter and the Moulin Rouge and the Gigi man. Particularly I like the .","High","Low","Low"

And I also can't do really bad scene videos because like I'm just using a laptop computer with a webcam in it and that's how I make my videos. So, like, I don't really have any special effects, Macs slide, or the green screen anything. So I can't do back, um, I mean back, um, green screen background thingies and stuff.

"VLOG328","Good afternoon. It's Saturday August twenty ninth. My name is XXXX. My YouTube name is XXXX and I'm broadcasting to you from Perth, West Australia. This week on the XXXX. We'll be describing our favorite places of art. All the while participating and accepting one of the challenges. I'm going to accept a challenge of describing my painting without using a particular word. My favorite piece of artwork is a painting by a local west Australian artist called Ellen Norton. And the painting is called Man Receiving Insights. The painting is a very simple painting. There are only three elements. There's a man, a dog and the setting. Norton has painted the setting as a typical Australian beach from the north of our suburbs. From the north of our country. So in the immediate foreground we've got the red dirt of our out back and beyond that we've got the yellow sand of our beaches, a crystallized blue waters, typical of our oceans, and above that, our brilliant blue skies. And now I'm going to attempt to act out for you, the other two elements, the dog and the man. So, first of all, we'll start with the dog. Now the dog is painted on the left of the painting, about the middle and he's sitting on the bench. He's down on all four hunches. He's got a long mouth. And I think this Norton has painted this long mouth because it sort of retains a kind of an embarrassing sort of look. And then the only other element of the painting is the man. Now Norton's painted him with a white fluffy cap because you've got to depict yourself in these as suburban and Norton has painted this man with his back to us and he's doing this. That's right. He's leaping for joy. Now, Norton's included a little ticket here. She's painted the man nude. So it's these elements that I really find attractive about this painting. It's the simpleness of the construction. It's the hanged dog, embarrassed dog. And it's the man who's naked. He's leaping for joy. He's received insight. He's experienced a eureka moment. I think that Norton has so effectively planted this that the metaphor that I interested was that like how casting aside his clothes, the man's realized that he's going to cast aside your inhibitions. You can experience joy and eureka moments. So, I hope you've enjoyed my description. I hope that you might be able to find a link to the painting somewhere on the . Please check out my channel.

"VLOG329","﻿Okay. I would just like to say thank you to everyone who commented and stuff.On my last video -- I'm outside to get beautiful singing sounds of the birds. You probably see the evil crow over there. We have an evil crow in our neighborhood. Um, anyway. I yeah, I would really like to thank everyone because you'd not believe how much that helped me. Um, and also people like Millie and Lauren and Mel who kind of ran at me at school and sort of gave me a hug, and I'm not really the huggy type of person but that was amazing. So thank you guys so much. Um, I started eating again which some people say is a good thing. Anyway I got Facebook married to Pedro so me and Lanky are like married now and stuff. Um, yeah. We were talking about relationship statutes anyhow and how Laura wanted to make herself a fake boyfriend so she could be married on Facebook. I'm like, you could just marry me, and she's like, Oh, I don't want to marry you, and I'm like fine I'll find someone else to marry me then. So I advertised it on Twitter and within like two minutes, um, Pedro was like Oh, can I marry you?  All right then. So that was -- that was interesting. Yeah.I am going to try to keep all my videos positive from now on and when I'm feeling like crap I won't make a video because that last one was really weird and stuff and, yeah. It's finally almost really pretty much spring now, yes. Happiness. It's all like sun when it's actually not. It's like cloud there, but, apart from that, it's bright and it's sunny and it's happy and it's all good. So -- also I have cool earrings of an axe and 'cause my fringe is in the way and a sword but I think they're pretty cool. But I also have some other ones but they're pretty cool too.I've gotten really into hand sanitizer. Not product placements that are all bi Aquium but like, like hand sanitizer in general is pretty cool at the moment. There are a lot of bugs.Moving on, I want to know who is going to be going to Animania . Animania is an Adelaide anime convention. There is another one -- and that's the phone ringing, but I can't get it. Sorry Mum. Anyway, I want to know who is going to Animania because Animania is going to be greatness in big proportions. I mean it only goes for five hours but like, five hours, that's -- that's just .Um, yeah. I wanna know who's going to Animania because I will want to meet you there and I need ideas as to what to cause plans, so I need someone to -- I need you to recommend to me anime and Mango -- no not Mango. Anime things that I could just go to JB hi fi and buy the DVDs of so I can just, in my spare time of which I have none, I can watch them and I can get addicted to certain theories and then I can go cosplaying with that character from that series and be well, yeah, I totally know what the series is about. I haven't only been watching it for a month and it will be all okay. So October tenth, Animania, who is going? Oh, you're not going? I won't be your friend then. Oh, go away.I'm saying, please don't leave me. I send my love to everybody who helps me out because you're all amazing and -- and -- thank you. Uh, anyway, um, flowers.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG33","﻿Hi Youtube. We're back. It is Friday, September the fourth, which means this weekend is Labor Day Weekend and XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX will be here, so -- they're actually already in town, but they're just getting ready and stuff, so we're waiting for them.Decided we should make a video just to let you guys know what's up. Chloe had her six month shot on, I think it's Wednesday, so two days ago and she did really well. She didn't even cry this time, so I'm really proud of her. What else? Seventeen pounds fifteen ounces, she's a big girl. And um, what else? She has a little bit of a cold right now, just a runny nose, but other than that, she's doing great and she just crawled this morning. Not very far, just to get a toy, but she crawled, so that's the important thing, right Chloe?Um, say hi everyone, say hi. What are you doing? She's kinda busy tearing everything apart at the moment, throwing all my stuff off the desk, so I guess I should be going.Um, me and XXXX will probably have a video for everyone up soon of our kids together, Chris and Chloe, and until then, have a good Labor Day Weekend and I hope everyone's having fun or camping or doing whatever. So have a good weekend and I'll see you soon. Bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG330","Hi. I'm making my first advice video, um, a little bit earlier than I intended. And it is for XXXX fan, XXXX, who video responded my last video, asking me a question. Um, before I do that -- before I give her my advice, I would just like to clarify that you want me to give you advice, you don't need to upload video unless you want to. Um, you can just e mail me at ask marbles at gmail. com and stay totally anonymous if you want. Just sign in as you'd like me to refer to you as. Does that make any sense? I don't know.If my voice sounds a little bit weird, I woke up with a cold today. Boo. So she asks me, um, what do I do when people make fun of me because I like Twilight? Um, you know, I have -- I myself, obviously have received a lot of, um, teasing, not just from, uh, people I don't know, but, like, friends and family and, you know, a lot from guys. Lots of guys. Ohhh, you like that Twilight stuff, well. Especially from people who haven't even actually read the books or seen the movie, they're just sick of seeing it everywhere and kind of approach it as High School Musical, but for like emo children.Mm, I don't know. Basically, you just gotta keep in mind that it's not actually personal and that, really, the person they're making fun of is themselves, especially in the case of them having not read the book or seen the movie. I mean, people are entitled to their opinions, obviously. But no one should ever make fun of you for liking something that they don't, unless it's done kind of, you know, playfully. And people will always tease each other about that kind of thing. Like, um, growing up I always used to make fun of my younger brother for liking Mighty Machines 'cause I thought it was the most boring show of life, basically.So the best thing you can do in that situation, whether it be, uh, in the comments on the video or -- or some random person at school who's commenting on your Team Edward shirt, or a family member, or whatever, is just keep in mind, well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. And you can say that -- look them dead in the eye when you say that, everyone's entitled to their own opinion. There isn't much more they can say to that, because you're not -- even when you're disagreeing with them, you're kinda agreeing to disagree. And don't let other people, you know, knock you down just over something you happen to like. In the end their opinion, when it comes to your interest, doesn't matter. I think that helps.So click update while I'm, uh, making this video real quick. I've gotten a lot of responses to the book club thing. And I'm going to say the ones that are up for votes, will be, obviously, The One Hundred Names, The Immortal Instruments series and anything by John Green. Those seem to be the three most popular.So in comments, throw out which of the three you would prefer to have me talk about. And maybe you have advice for AJ. Probably you should give it to her as well. I'm going to -- well, obviously, make this a video response to her video, but until that happens I'll also link her video on the side.So. Ahh. Good times. I'm sorry; I wish I was more energetic. Oh, oh, and by the way, everybody who's been sending me private messages of encouragement, thank you so much. I do read them. I do. And, um, I'm trying to reply to all of them. And I do read all your comments as well. And I appreciate every piece of encouragement I've received.So, peace out. Peace out. Really. It's come to that, hasn't it?","Low","High","High"
"VLOG331","﻿Ladies and gentlemen, how're you all doing? My name is XXXX and I look for opportunities.Um, you know uh, just a lot of stuff's been going on which is why I haven't really posted a video in a while. Um, just a lotta -- a lotta -- a lotta family stuff and friends and whatnot. Anyways, um, you know, it's bad stuff, but, you know, you gotta move on from it. So that's what I'm doing.Um, it's -- some of you guys -- I don't know. Just so you guys know, I'm a hundred seventy two pounds now. Um, but that's probably because of the stress so not necessarily a good, uh, eating habit.Um, I've been working out a lot more. Every morning I do about uh, thirty to fifty pushups uh, just to get my day going. And then I try to do a little workout throughout the day. Um, so, you know, just -- that's just a little update for you guys. I'm sorry I didn't really, you know, uh, go with the daily blogs all the time. But um, I'm just letting you guys know, a hundred seventy two pounds. I'm working out pretty much every day now and um, you know, it's pretty good.Um, and yesterday I uh, was helping my friend and his brother film something for his girlfriend. Um, it's like a micro Christmas thing. And I am going -- I might put that on this channel. It's not like I have any other channel to put it on, but I might put it on here. Kind of -- I think -- you know, I was filming it and stuff like that and I felt a little direct and it was -- it was a lot of fun. So uh, hopefully you guys will see that pretty soon.Um, anyway, I have a lot more raps that I would love to get out and a lot more songs that I'd love to get out. So um, that's kind a what this channel's turning into. A lot of rap and songs and blogs.Um, I used my skip, but I just don't have time to skipping right now. Um, but anyway um, you know, that's enough out of me.So thanks for watching and stay healthy and I hope you have a happy holiday if I don't talk to you before and -- yeah -- that's it.You guys have a good one.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG332","Hey guys, it's me XXXX. I know I -- I think I said in my last video I was going to shave off my mustache, but somebody commented on it saying it looked like the anti Hitler, because Hitler had the, um, hair in the middle and on my hair -- I have no hair here at all. It seems to be curling out the side like this, so I decided to keep it, you know, for a couple more weeks or so though I'd shave it off. Because if I shave it off I look a lot younger and I'm twenty one and I want to look as young as possible, you know?Um, so yeah, uh, basically -- oh, I got one more thing before I start on my actual topic that I'm going to do today. I think Adam Lambert got robbed on American Idol. He should've won. It should've been Danny and Adam in the bottom -- I mean in the top two, bottom two. Should've been Danny and Adam in the top two with Adam winning or even if Danny won, it would've seemed more realistic than Kris Allen winning. I think Kris Allen is a little bit -- gonna get my shirt words on it. Uh, I think Kris Allen's not that good of a performer. He doesn't really live to the name of an American Idol. Neither does Taylor Hicks, season five. I thought he was just like, you know, one of the joke kind of contestants like Sanjaya was in season six. And I can't think of any other ones offhand, but you know what I mean.Um, yeah, so anyways I work at Taco Bell and I've worked there for about a year and a half now and strangely enough I enjoy working there. I know it seems strange like, oh my God, someone actually works -- likes working for a fast food? Well, yes I do, I enjoy it and -- 'cause really it's not just the whole job aspect that I enjoy, I actually like the people I work with. They're so laid back and they're so, you know, accepting of me as a person as well as, you know, my situations -- that I had been put in situations that I have that I will discuss later on with you guys.And my boss is very lenient with my schedule and understands all my situations pretty well and I'm thankful for that and you know, a job is a job no matter what. You should be thankful that you even have a job no matter how low in the food chain that job is. And I get a paycheck every two weeks and I'm fine. I mean, I can survive on what I get. I can make it work.And -- oh, and you're probably all wondering the background, like you have a Coca Cola room? Trust me, it's not my idea, I swear, but I'll go into why my room is like this in another video.Anyways, back on topic. Um, so yeah, I like my job 'cause it's actually -- and there's a lot of diverse people at the Taco Bell that I work at. Mexican people, black people, gay people, me, a couple of people are bisexuals there. Um, men, women, children -- well, not children, minors, you know. Old, young, middle age.And even have our own little pet ducks at work too. So I know it seems kinda odd, but my boss takes care of the ducks outside of the drive thru and we use all the food that we don't need -- all the -- anything that's dried up or old, we just, you know, tear up. We put it in a thing called a duck box and we set the duck box outside and the little ducks come and eat their uh, eat the food.So, yeah, it's kinda cool and I think I'm very lucky to have the job that I have with the people that I work with, 'cause the people that I work with are probably one in a million. The crew is probably one in a million chance that I would work with them because they're so funny and nice and -- and -- and, you know, team -- huge team players. Yeah, we all make mistakes but, you know, who doesn't make mistakes?I mean, it's just a great place. It's a great environment and I -- that's surprising considering I live in California, but I'm not going to get into that. I like California, I do, but certain places in it scare me to death so that's why I don't travel that much anywhere in California. I practically stay in Stockton here most of the time.Um, so yeah, that's about it, that's about what I do. You're probably thinking, oh God, this blog is kinda boring -- I'm -- well, I promise you, once I get all the personal stuff about myself -- personal stuff about myself out of the way, then I'll start diving into some of the other topics like how I came out.That's probably really juicy, that's a funny story about how I came out and why I came out and who I came out to and what was the background behind that and, you know? It was really funny. It's actually kinda work related too, so, yeah.So guys, I hope you guys have a good summer 'cause school's out amongst other things. I'm out, school's out, I came out saying here schools' out. See how that works?I know that's kind boring, whoop dee doo. Anyways, um, so I hope to see you guys later, maybe in a couple of days.I wanna try to do these blogs as frequently as I possibly can. I've just been really really busy with work. But now that everyone is out of school, I should be able to do these at least once or twice a week and I -- trust me, I'll have subjects galore for these blogs and um, I hope you guys will subscribe and follow me -- that's twitter, something different, huh?Anyways, yeah, in the description box, this way -- no this way, right? No, this way. I couldn't remember, it's sorta like a mirror image so I'm pointing the wrong way. In the description box on this side, over here, this way -- I don't know how to do that right then, um, you'll find the link to my MySpace, so if you want to, friend request me on MySpace, go ahead, post a comment, do whatever you want.Uh, yeah so that's about it for this blog for today.

"VLOG333","﻿Bonjour. Hey Twilighters. It's Friday and today is fantastic because I went to Walmart and right in the door, I saw these really crazy like, bottles of soda. I'm like, oh, it's so cute, it's a little ornament. So I'm actually going to make an ornament out of this bottle of soda. It seriously is a bottle of soda, look. Now, woo. . Ah!So this week is probably a week that I do not want to remember ever. This is the last week I'll get to see Sana . Hopefully I'll be able to see her either tomorrow or sometime next week before she leaves. I don't want her to go, but let's not talk about goodbyes, because it's never really goodbye. We're always going to be friends and hello Skype. It's going to be sad not hanging out with her all the time.So, I went to see New Moon again. It's like, gets better every time I see it. It really cracks me up, because I am just in love with the idea of face punch. Face punch, I love it . Plus the fact that it's blatantly making fun of Hollywood action films. I still think it's fucking hilarious, so I did a face punch trailer just for you guys. ﻿I have some challenges I need to get out of the way. Both of these challenges are from XXXX.Challenge numero uno. XXXX challenged me to go into a bookstore and find as many books as I possibly can on vampires. Well, I haven't been able to go to a bookstore recently, so I went to borders dot com and found several vampire titles. Including The Vampire Diaries, The Vampire Academy, Cirque du Freak, Interview with a Vampire, The Thirst Novels, The Coffin Club, and Dance of the Vampire. Those were just a few I found -- there are so many more out there. And actually, it makes me wonder -- if you write a novel about vampires, is it going to be published because it's popular?I think I just figured out how I'm going to get my book published. The subject -- vampires. Ta da! Instant bestseller. No, I don't know, but I just think that there are so many -- it's kind of freaking me out that there are so many vampire novels actually out there and I do like a few.Challenge numero dos. XXXX also challenged me to make a attractive face like Rob did in one of his recent interviews. So here goes nothing.So also when I went in to go see New Moon again I realized how much I freaking love Michael Sheen, to the point where I just wanted to hug him. He's freaking awesome as Aro and I realized that I didn't put him on my list of things that I liked about New Moon so I wanted to kind of dedicate this blog to his awesomeness. Seriously, when Michael Sheen came onscreen as Aro, I thought I was going to die because he just kind of took over that portion of the movie. His acting was superb and actually, it fit exactly how I imagined Aro in the books. He was so intimidating, yet very, like, welcoming at the same time and I couldn't quite pinpoint why I felt, like, drawn to him and yet repulsed by him at the same time.So, um, I thought I'd bring this up right now -- um, fifty book challenge for this year has officially failed for me. I think I read, like, ten and actually I just got done reading this book. It's called Guitar Girl by Sarra Manning. It's really good and I -- I just enjoyed it because it was, like, all about the real story of a teen band and how fame kind of corrupted people and -- basically it's about how people aren't really what they seem to be in real life and people are just out for money and for themselves and it's really good. I just -- I teared up at the end, it was really cute.Next I will be reading this book. Whoo hoo, I'm jumping on the bandwagon. No, seriously, I've been meaning to read it for a while, but y'all are saying how awesome it is, so I'm going to read it. Don't know what this is; it's like reading ninja. Whoo, reading ninja.Friday, I will see you Twilighters again and, um, Monday, maybe XXXX? Maybe? If not, XXXX, I'll see you on Tuesday -- or before.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG334","﻿Hey guys, sorry it's been so long since I last posted a video. I really got caught up in, basically, school. I mean, how cliché is that? Everybody's caught up in school right now. I noticed that a lot of users -- users, ha -- no, people who make YouTube videos -- um, they stop making videos for a few weeks when the school year starts. So, hopefully, you know, people haven't been wondering where I was and thinking that I wasn't gonna come back. But, I'm back, and I'm really going to try and start making videos more consistently. It was just during the summer that I had a lot of time to, uh, waste -- not that YouTube's wasting my time, ha.So, basically I've been doing school, taking a sewing class at this art school I go to. And it's really cool, it's a little bit overwhelming 'cause I've never really used a machine before, and I'm just like - rrr, pch, pch, pch. I really want to do fashion design as my future, and I figured okay, well maybe I should sew so that I know what I'm doing. obviously.I was really bored one night and I just took a scissors to the face -- head -- region. I kinda wanted a whole Betty Page look -- you know, like, forties pinup. So, hopefully that's what comes across, because I just want to look like a calendar girl bimbo all the time. And there's so many times where I was like, I should make a video. I'm like, well, I'll just read this book. I was reading this book called Shiver. I don't know if anybody else has read it. If you have, leave me a comment telling me what you thought of it, because I was kind of half and half with it, 'cause it's a Stephanie Meyer ripoff with the whole werewolf, true love thing. Umm, it was kind of Jacobish ey, and then kind of an Edward thing mixed in, like I can’t love you 'cause you're a werewolf, vampire, and we can't be together. It was like, we'll find a way. Oh, low battery -- crapface. I'm just gonna stop it here and then -- so this is Shiver.Um, if I was going love hate society ratings, I would probably rate a three -- maybe like three and a half, 'cause it definitely was inspired by Twilight and, 'cause the whole werewolf vampire obsession thing really wasn't so romantic before, 'cause the whole idea of falling in love with a werewolf was never quite that appealing until Twilight came along.I made the mistake of trying to make these freaking pompom things -- I hate them. Like, oh gosh, if anybody knows how to make these, then please give me the most dumbed down directions that you can possibly ever give a person, because I can't understand directions for crap. I ended rolling this whole thing and then cutting it, and the the whole thing just fell apart after -- after I've been rolling this yarn for about, err, two hours -- yeah, two hours. And then the whole thing just fell apart, so I kind of like cried and screamed and stomped around the house and um, physically abused the sock -- it's got some dents. Uh, that's how I deal with my rage, eh.I started watching America's Next Top Model. And I started watching it, and I was shocked, 'cause this is Season -- or Cycle -- thirteen, and it's for short people. And I have nothing against short people. I think that short people are beautiful, um, just as beautiful as someone who is tall. Sometimes short people are prettier than tall people. But, for real, like, it's just -- sorry, you can't really be a model if you're really short. It just doesn't happen.And it kind of made the show even lamer than it already is, 'cause Tyra is just such a freak now. Like, I -- I think Tyra Banks is really nice and stuff, but every show she just gets weirder and weirder. Like, what was it, the first episode? She was talking in a French accent half of the time, and one season before, I know that she was dressed up like a princess and she put on a skit with the Mister and Misses Jays or whatever they are. And they were like Prince Charming and Miss Jay was a witch or something. It was the weirdest thing, and I was just like -- wow, this show is really desperate. Um, and then there was a space themed one. It was -- it's getting really weird and over the top. I'm gonna to cry right now. I'm really sad. Meh, what do you think of my fringe? A lot of people don't think I look the same, but you know, hey, I'm the same. Because every single subscriber means so much to me.So, um, yeah, oh and the XXXX Channel -- um, I feel horrible about that too. The XXXX Channel really hasn't been -- it's on hiatus, basically. XXXX like quit and then we all decided to take a break, and then XXXX was gonna come back when we're all done with the break. And it's been a while, and we we're gonna make a video saying that we're going on break, but that never happened. And we're just all very scattered and -- I don't know, I think that we'll work out, but we're not really sweating it right now 'cause we really don't want to be, like, you know, uff, Collab Channel nazis. And um, we're just gonna chill for a while, and maybe during Christmas break or -- or something -- we'll start making videos again.But I really hope that nobody unsubscribes, because it is a really good channel and I think that we have a lot potential. But we're all a bunch of teenagers who still go to high school and have kind of crazy lives. So, um, hang in there with us, and we'll be posting videos, um, when we're all finally settled down. So yeah, thank you for watching this really long video. I hope that you didn't die of boredom. But yeah, I'll talk to you guys later. Bye.","High","High","Low"

Um, this is something I've learnt to deal with and I thought it was about time that you understood what it's like to live the way that I do. Um, although no one in my family suffered from this, it wasn't until school -- -- it wasn't until school that I became truly aware of how unique I was.The school kids say -- they used to call me names and the teachers used to make me sit at the back of the classroom with a bucket, and by the end of most lessons it was usually about full to the brim . I mean, can you imagine what it's like taking your GCSE exams when you're suffering from what I've got?There are some mornings when I wake up and I -- I don't even need to shower .

"VLOG338","﻿Welcome to XXXX. This is part one of four, counting down the top thirty one videos of the entire year. YouTube has this new page out -- Youtube dot com slash newyears, where every day they put out a new video, and it's super fun and exciting. It's the entire reason I stay up late. Waiting to see the new video get posted. So let's go right into it and cover the videos that have already been released.I doubt this is in any particular order. I think it's just by the day. All these videos are total collectively best videos of two thousand nine. First video -- Mister Guitar Man. Awesome, I loved Joe, his Video Guitar Impossible. Now, I love this video for the technical expertise, obviously, in the editing and everything else. But personally, I wish they would have chosen the one with the water glasses, playing them with the pens, because that was my favorite that Joe put out this year. I just fell in love with that video.Second video is Biscuit the Sleepwalking Dog. You knew that viral video was gonna be in this list somewhere, and it came out the second day. It's where the dog is sleeping and starts running and then like, wakes itself up and runs into the wall and it's hilarious, and it's so cute.Another one you knew was gonna be up there -- Fred, his One Million Subscribers video. I think it's interesting how of all the Fred videos, they chose that one. But obviously they would, because it was the first person ever to get a million subscribers on the website. So, congratulations Fred -- obviously, you had an amazing two thousand nine.The fourth video is the Know You're Mean Boxy video and special bonus -- they linked to original Boxy Video. Um, can you believe that Boxy came out in January, so it's pretty much been a year since Boxy came onto the scene. That just blows my mind.The fifth video that came out was a video I've never even seen. So it was kind of interesting to get to watch one of the popular videos of two thousand nine for the first time. It's The Guild's Alluring Avatar. It was a really funny video -- I liked it but, yeah, it was good. I -- I wish I had known about it 'cause it's one of those weird things where it's like, I've never seen this before and now I'm being told it's one of the top videos of two thousand nine. Hmm, I don't know how I feel about that. But obviously, if you've seen, you agree with it because it is a very well done video. So, congratulations to the Guild. I don't mean holding his toothpaste wasn't in the shot just then.The sixth video came from Shane Dawson TV. Obviously two thousand nine, we've all said was the year of the Dawson, and um, no surprise they were gonna put him on the list. But I'm very surprised that they chose his very emotional and serious Father's Day video. Yes, the beginning is very funny, but it turns very serious and very personal very quickly. And I think that day that video came out, we all got to see for the first time a very personal side of Shane. And it was such a blessing for him to share that with us. And I am very surprised that put that out there. I'm really glad they did, because I think it's awesome that he shared that with us. And you know, there lot's of people out there that don't have fathers and can very much relate to that situation, um, but I would've thought YouTube would very much keep every thing very, you know, lively and happy. And the fact that they, you know, took it serious and you know, not everything is happy go lucky on YouTube as in life -- um, I'm very, uh, proud of them. And yeah, I think it was a good thing that they chose that video.The seventh video that came out was United Breaks Guitars. Ouch, um -- this video is just about this guy singing about how United broke his guitar. He's a band I've never heard of -- a video I've never seen. Um, and the video -- I'm sorry, not really impressed. Six million views -- impressive. Good job on, you know, getting a viral video out there and, uh, the whole theme of this day I guess of putting this video out was -- oh, clever way to get attention to a problem. Yeah, but United didn't solve those problems, so it really wasn't that great. And if the video was a little better, United would've replaced his guitar. Ooo, bad. the video they put out today, the only one we have left to talk about is We Fail Is A Big Win. Um, yes, I absolutely remember all of those we fail videos of people not having their wrist strap on and throwing the little chuck and into the TV it went. And, oh my goodness, all those plasma high def TV screens that got ruined this year because of the Wi -- oh lordy, don't even get me started on that money. But, thank God I've never done that, because I don't own a Wi, but if I did, you know that strap would be on my wrist at all times. I do not have to ruin my TV, but yeah -- hilarious, hilarious videos. I'm glad they chose that, because -- and that was kind of a very viral thing at the beginning of this year, wasn't it? I feel like it was.Those are all the videos that they've released so far. You need to go and check out and bookmark XXXX so you can see them come out every day. Next Tuesday will be Part Two, where I'll cover the next seven videos that they've released in those seven consecutive days. Uh, thank you so much for watching XXXX. Um, be sure to come back on Friday for XXXX. And I'm really just kind of excited for you to come back next week, because I'm really excited to see the next seven days, and I can't wait to see the rest of the videos that are the top thirty one of the year. Uh, I'm very excited obviously, and also kind of sick which is which this video was a little chit -- showy. But anyways, thank you so much and I'll, uh, talk to you all later, right? Bye.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG339","Uh, hey good morning it's Warn's lake. How are you doing?Um, as many of you know uh, uh, a few weeks ago Bart the Fish, Canada's best loved political fish passed away. It was a very sad uh, time for -- for many thousands of Canadians and a lot of people wondered how can Bart ever be replaced. Well, Bart has been replaced.Um, uh, I don't know if any of you uh, are aware of the fact that I'm kind of into Star Trek. Um, episode forty four broadcasted in December of nineteen sixty seven written by David Gerrold, won many of awards. Uh, Rohant Assdy wrote a song about it uh, called the Trouble with Tribbles and uh, I -- I just wanted to show you here's a -- here's a tribble, can you hear him ?This is a real tribble. See, he's got the real Star Trek thing on it. Um, we call him Greg. So this is uh, Greg the Tribble and um, Greg is, uh, gotta pretty smart political brain. So for example here uh, just listen carefully. Uh, Dalton Agetti . He likes Dalton Agetti.Uh, uh, how about, um, um, how about Mike McManieth ? Ah, that's a nice Tribble. Okay um, okay, how about, oop, Steven Herper , George Bush? He -- he doesn't like them. Steven Harper, George Bush, wow. Greg the Tribble has and acute sense of political, um, smarts.Anyway um, so here you go. Here's Greg, yeah. Say hi to him you are going to get to know him quite a bit over the next little while and ah, have a great day from -- from me and Greg.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG340","﻿Hi, I would like to bring to your attention a new type of hatred, emo bashing. Twice, over the past two days; that's once a day I have been subjected to this by what I refer to as Nazi Aryan elitists. The most shocking thing about all of this; I'm not even emo. Apparently, because I dye my hair; listen to Fallout Boy, My Chemical Romance, and All American Rejects; dress in skull themed black clothing; and refer to myself as emo on Myspace, FaceBook, BeBo and as much as possible. These conformist pigs have labeled me an emo.But what is emo bashing? Well I'll give you two examples. First of all, I was at this party and I'd sabotaged this music system to play nothing but real music, and this chick was like, uh, what's with all the emo music? And I found this really hurtful and really, really super unfair. So, I turned around and said to her what's wrong with emos? And then she responded, and I'm not exaggerating, oh my cat, I'm not exaggerating, because I'm not exaggerating just to make my stories more credible, but she said emos, they're all whiney, arrogant, self absorbed, losers, and it doesn't help that they look ridiculous.Well, here's my well thought out response that I responded with, maybe I said it at the time or I thought it up later, don't be sassy, you obviously are too closed minded to understand anything, you capitalist. How can you judge people based on a biased opinion like that? How many emos did you even know? None. Then how can you make blanket assumptions about their personalities? Unned .And I mean, I don't mean to compare the mild dislike of the subculture as something as serious as racism, but this is tantamount to racism. I mean, look at slavery if George Washington, or whoever was in charge of that, had sat down and talked to some slaves maybe he would have liked them. I mean, rap music does suck, but it's still possible. And then this morning some chick outed me from MySpace and she was, like, really rude. She told me that my blogs were really retarded and that I need to get a life, because I didn't have one. I was so angry that I skipped university to make this video blog. What a bi -","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG341","﻿Okay. So it's not kind of shining, but just forget that. Um, hello everybody. I am making a video because I have nothing else to do but I really don't know what to talk about, so I'm just going to go with the flow here.First of all, look at my amazing shirt. It's a peace shirt. I got that from Hot Topic when I went. Oh, I went out of town this past week and I went to, um, with my mom and yeah, I had a lot of fun. It's kinda boring, 'cause like, you know, I'm vegetarian, right? And it's, like, really, really hard to find a vegetarian alternative at places. You know, cause you usually I don't eat out anymore really. I used to eat stuff at the house so it was kind of tricky with that. I think I probably lost a couple of pounds, but yeah. So that is all with that. My mom did pretty good I think and yeah, so, I don't really -- I don't really have anything, really have anything going on right now. Um, yeah.Let's see, my birthday is coming up very soon. But it is actually a friend of mine's birthday, his name is Ryan and, um, I was going to say happy birthday on here and so happy birthday and he probably doesn't watch this but I don't really care. I'm just going to say it anyways. But my birthday is real soon. I'll be seventeen. I think I already said that on my past video. I don't know but I'm getting excited for it and this is great news, everybody. I am not afraid to talk on the phone anymore, and, I got a Skype so anybody who wants my Skype or something or just wants to talk to me on Skype, ask me and I will give it to you. Okay? And we'll talk on there. So yeah, that was probably all for now, just a little update you know, stuff like that. Uh, phbbbth, don't know.My hair -- I my hair earlier and it's becoming like an afro, really bad and I don't know what to do. I want to get a haircut but I don't want it really short because this is with gel and it looks good with gel still. And then like a little, a little, uh, like frizzy but that's about it so, yeah. I will probably make another video soon, and I will talk to you all later.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG343","Hello internet, I just can't concentrate on anything anymore. Here I am, I have a quick question and that question is do you know what the Project for Awesome is? If you don't go to this link and read about the Project for Awesome; if you do I can go right into the question I'm going to ask; what charities do you support? If you are not taking part in the Project for Awesome this year, I need to know what charities you guys think are most important. I already have a couple that I support, but I need one specific charity; not really picky about what it supports that I can do for the Project for Awesome this year. I was going to do one last year, and I was going to do Save Darfur, but I never got around to making the videos so I kind of, you know, just put it on hold, but this year I really, really, really want to do Project for Awesome so I need your input; what charities do you guys think are the most important? Leave me a comment; send me a video response or message and let me know what you guys think.I have two YouTube accounts so I might do two videos, we'll see what happens, but I need to know what you guys think and I'll compare your responses with what I already had in mind and we'll go from there.If my head looks a little bit weirder than normal, it's because I got a haircut and it's really short. It's a little bit shorter than I hoped and I've had a hat on all day; so it looks really weird, but I don't know I'm kind of getting used to it; that's the beard I guess. I don't know. For some reason my beard doesn't grow as well as Shay Carl's does. So I'm never going to have an awesome fuzzy, grizzly Adams beard; like Shay.What else happened, I went on a hunting trip with my dad. We saw about seven deer total, one small buck and six doe; including the one that ran out in front of us as we were driving home from the bar. I saw some Cougar tracks and we also had a verbal argument with a porcupine, which was kind of exciting.I also got Blu ray from Wal Mart, they had it priced at twenty bucks and it rang up as fifteen. It really surprised me because this one comes with the blu ray, the special features and this is where the regular DVD goes, people are actually watching it downstairs and it also comes with the digital copy. Let's see, it says there right there on the back. I was really, really excited to get this because on the special features they have footage from the Deathly Hollows. If you haven't bought it yet, I recommend doing so. If you guys don't already know I'm a hardcore Harry Potter fanatic and I was sitting here yesterday and I was watching the movie; I started to get really, really giddy and excited and when I watched the footage from the Deathly Hollows; and I kind of a did a little face palm because I realized I was trying to do what one of those Twilight fans would do and then I realized that Harry Potter is so much better than Twilight on every level imaginable; and I felt okay about it again.If you guys haven't checked out averagewizard. com, do so. It's really cool. It's kind of like that FMLs and the MLIA for Harry Potter fanatics; and there's a Twilight one as well, but I've been, you know, staying away from it because it's Twilight. I mean I enjoyed the books when I read them, but this whole fan base is just ridiculous. Harry Potter teaches to overcome adversity and keep your friends close and, you know, to treasure life. Twilight teaches pedophilia and bestiality. .Seven up is the best drink ever. I used to be obsessed with Sierra Mist and then I started drinking Seven Up again; and it's actually a little bit better for you. I mean it's still pop, soda, fizzy drink whatever you guys call it where you're from. It's not good for you at all in general, but over Sprite and Coke and Sierra Mist and Pepsi, this is actually better for you because it's all natural flavors; and there's really no additives other than corn syrup. So I really like Seven Up, but I'm trying to get off pop completely.I know I'm kind of late in the dedication to December, so I'll like start that on the fifteenth and just do half way through December and January.Oh, one more thing, this New Year's I'm going down to Pittsburg to spend that period of time with my guitarist, Kevin, and his wife Hilary and Kevin and I are going to be recording some tracks. If you guys haven't checked us out on MySpace, I'm going to put the link right here at the bottom. Be sure to check this out, add us, and listen to the tracks that Kevin has already laid down. None of my vocal tracks are up there just yet. I haven't had really a chance to record anything good; my house is always full of people and it's just, you know, hard to record anything here. So when I go down there we're going to get some recording done and we will have a studio EP within the coming months; so keep an ear out for us; add us on MySpace; we're going to have a YouTube where we're hopefully going to have some unplugged taped stuff. So who knows; and if you like it you do; and if you don't well tell us; tell us why you don't like it; maybe we can do something that suites your taste.Thanks for watching and I will see you guys later. Peace.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG344","Hey YouTube, it's XXXX here. How many bloody times have you heard a theist say something like this?Well if you don't believe in God, then where do you get your morality from?Yeah. We've all heard derivatives of this from the likes of douche bags like William Lane Craig, Ravi Zacharias, etcetera, etcetera. Indeed Christians like to bleat this like the sheep that they are ad nauseum. I know this is a tired topic but bear with me, okay?Now I've heard some needlessly ornate rebuttals to this, usually utilizing some convoluted philosophical principle that underlines the philosophy of their argument. But as most of you know by now, XXXX don't go in for all of that fancy book learning. I'm a pretty simple guy, and I'm gonna give you all some common sense here, okay? When asked, where do you get your morality from?I usually give a quick answer. And that is, from the same place you do. Myself. And today I'm going to prove it to you. Now my morality as I said is from myself. Essentially, it's more complicated than that but the bottom line is, I assess situations and make moral decisions based on my experience and I judge something to be immoral or moral. I am the filter. Now many theists especially Christians and Muslims subscribe to the idea of divine command theory. Now in a nutshell, divine command theory says that God defines what is moral and immoral, therefore if God commands something it is therefore moral by definition. Now I'm gonna disregard for a moment here in that God's existence has yet to be established, and so no one's in a position to say what God has or has not said at least from a scriptural perspective. Well let's just deal with the claim itself.Let me give Mr. Hypothetical Christian a hypothetical scenario. Let's say that one day Mr. Hypothetical Christian is in prayer. And as he is praying, all of a sudden he is blinded by a light and he hears a booming voice and he says, Mr. Christian. Yes, Lord. Is that you speaking to me in an audible voice? Yes, it is. What an honor, Lord. Mr. Christian, there is an old woman named Thelma Johnson who lives at seventy thirty six Autobahn Street in your home town. I am commanding you to go and buy her a bouquet of flowers, deliver them to her, and tell them I asked you to do this. I promise you will be blessed. I, the Lord have spoken.Oh wow, Lord. I can't believe this. This is incredible, thank you. So then Mr. Hypothetical Christian goes and does exactly that, goes and buys a bouquet of flowers and brings them to Mrs. Johnson. Now upon hearing that God asked Mr. Hypothetical Christian to bring her the flowers, Mrs. Johnson is elated, she starts crying, they embrace and start praising God together. Now Mr. Christian, granted you may never have experienced anything like this but what you're say, that this is a reasonable scenario I've drawn out here, that if in fact you heard that voice, you would do that, right?Yeah, I suppose so, yeah that sounds good, certainly it would be pretty amazing to hear God's voice audibly I mean he usually doesn't work that way but yeah, that would be wonderful, sure. What a faith affirming thing that would be.Okay, fair enough. What if you do a different scenario? Suppose same day, you're praying, blinding light, booming voice. Only this time here's what you hear. Mr. Christian. Yes Lord. Oh my gosh are you speaking to me audibly? Yes Mr. Christian. There is a man living in Van Nuys, California whose very life is an affront to me. He has done wickedness in my sight and is very dangerous. I have chosen you as my emissary of divine justice. Go now and find Mr. Edgar Schnalverdoff he lives at one twenty nine Cedar Street in Van Nuys. Find him and kill him by whatever means necessary. Tell no one of your quest. Once his life is at an end I will see to it that the authorities do not suspect you and great will your reward be in Heaven. I, the Lord have spoken.Huh? So okay Mr. Hypothetical Christian, now I pose you this second question. Would you do that? Nah uh, no -- why not? Are you saying God is wrong or is asking you to do something immoral? No you'd get it. God would never command you to do an evil action like that. Really? But you just heard a booming voice, you saw a blinding light, there was no one else in your house, clearly it'sGod speaking to you and asking you to do this, right? No, you don't get it Mr. Atheist, the point is that even if I heard the booming voice and all that and it wasn't God, it was a demon posing as God because he asked me to commit a wicked action, a crime, murder. What is wrong with you atheists?Thank you. You're just proving my point. Did you catch it? When Mr. Hypothetical Christian was asked to bring flowers to Mrs. Johnson he was enthralled that God has chosen him to speak to audibly. He immediately went and did exactly as he was told, brought her the flowers and it was an incredible faith affirming event, they were crying, praising God and so on, right? But when Mr. hypothetical Christian was asked to go kill Edgar Schnalverdoff he then does not do what he's asked and in fact says that the booming voice was not God but a demon in disguise because God would never ask him to commit such a crime.All right, so let's distill this down now. Booming voice says, give flowers to old lady. Good. Must be God, I'm gonna do it. Booming voice says, go kill a man, not good must be not God but a demon in disguise, not gonna do it. Well Mr. Hypothetical Christian, you just use your own moral faculties to assess the situation and make a moral decision. Therefore I am correct by saying you and I use the same moral barometers. That's why you are baseless by saying to me that as an atheist I have no basis for my morality. I have the same fucking basis that you do.And something else I wanna add. I don't just, you know, just make moral decisions just based on how I feel on a given day. No. I have my whole life experience all that I've seen in my short thirty two years on this planet, but I also have history, I have other people's experiences to go on, and collectively we can come to an understanding as to what we think is going to be good for everyone and what is going to be bad. And you know what, a lot of shit is very complicated and it's not easy to always know what is the fully moral decision, and what is the immoral decision. But you know what though, by and large we do pretty much agree.The fact is I think it's pretty simple. Whatever causes the least amount of suffering as much as it depends on you, do that. Whatever is going to bring joy and happiness to people, do that. Whatever's gonna cause harm to any sentient being, either animals or human beings avoid that as much as possible. Now granted it's not always easy to do this and it's not always easy to know which is going to result in those things but that should be what we all strive to do. And if you need to be told why we should even do that, why suffering is bad and joy is good, you're a fucking sociopath and I've got no time for you. So, just something to think about. Thanks for watching.","High","Low","Low"

"VLOG348","So, this would be attempt number three for this evening, which looks like six when I do it this way, but really it's, like, emphasis on three. I had recorded once -- the one time before. I decided to give it a whirl a second time to see if I liked it better. I didn't, I decided on the first one, but apparently that was too long for YouTube, which I didn't find out until after it was, like, you know, converted and uploaded and viewed.So, now you see me after, you know, I've removed my makeup and my jewelry and stuff, so hi. And I've done some weird stuff to my hair which you won't get to see because that was in the other video, but uh, I'm gonna do some more weird things because I'm deciding to go with a different, you know, vibe entirely.This one's gonna be about knitting this hat. So, um, let's start with the first one. So when you get ready to knit, they usually tell you you have to swatch stuff which is more important when you're making a garment, like, you know, sweater, or something to wear, like, a skirt I guess. There are a lot of garments you can make. I haven't made them 'cause I stick with hats and scarves, 'cause they're small projects. And get done quickly and I'm satisfied with that.So uh, anyway, there was this hat pattern at, um -- I'm sleeping, don't mind me -- um, there was this hat pattern at Knitty's. com that I decided I wanted to try and so I didn't have the appropriate needle size so I figured well, I'll just go up one, it shouldn't be a big deal because I knit pretty tight most of the time anyway, which some of you who have gotten hats can probably attest to, right? Uh, anyway, so I went up in needle size, and -- and I didn't swatch, and I decided to make a large pattern version too and a hat that is supposed to pretty fitted for, you know, like, fitted around here, turned out like this. So, um, yeah, swatching, not always a bad thing, even for hats.And let's see, which one of these is the right one? Okay, so then there was this other one, this other pattern at Knitty's that I wanted to try 'cause it looked kinda cool, and it's also a hat, and uh, sometimes patterns are wrong. There was a misprint and there's a particular -- if you'll note, see these triangly sections here? Like, this one in the middle right here? That's -- that's a single patterny thing. I'm not sure how to describe it and a I'm doing a horrible job of it, but you repeat this a certain number of times in order to complete the hat.Well, the directions called for completing the first one and then doing it four more times. Well, when you do it four more times, this is what you get. And see, like this -- there's room in here, and technically that's supposed to be flipped up, so it looks like that but still -- see? Wide. So, I figured this out.I have been debating a weird point. My mom had wanted me to make a hat for her dad that was similar, only different colors and so they were trying to figure out like what the problem was. Like, did I need to go down a needle size? Had I knit too loosely, which is -- would be a new problem -- was a possibility, so I finally figured out that it was probably supposed to be a total repeat of four and not like, five, which is what that one was.So I tried it again and it's much better, and also appropriate. Ta da. But you know, apparently when it's looking too big on the needles that might be a good time to check for sure, which is kinda hard to tell 'cause that was straight knitting, like on straight needles, and then cleaning it up. I hate cleaning stuff up, by the way. But it's necessary for it to align.Also, side note. This is -- this is not gonna mean much probably to most of you if you don't knit, but um -- and now I'm trying to remember what this is called actually. Short rows, that's right. So these are achieved by very short rows.Well the first time I heard about short rows was in conjunction with um, it was like a lingerie pattern, and so it was making a bust line. Which is kinda like, you know, it was like three per cup more or less, but you know, for girls to go into. So the entire time I'm knitting, I feel like, you know, I'm in fifth grade because I snicker every so often thinking about the possibility that in reality -- cause when you around the needles, they kinda go out a little, like, kinda like -- oh, that's hard to tell. Anyway, kinda like that. I keep thinking of seeing the, you know, short rows being done and it's in order to create a cup to create for a bust and so -- so I'm totally immature. Snickering away while I'm knitting and you know, I'm sure if anyone was around, would've been looking at me peculiar -- oddly. Anyway, so that was my knitting gone wrong.I haven't actually done much knitting since then. I've got, like, a scarf on the needles right now. That's a secret thing that I need to get back to but it's so tedious 'cause it's, like, it's -- it's smaller than I'm used to. It's on size eight. Again, probably doesn't mean much to most of you and some of you are probably going nuts not because if you've seen some of the socks -- I've yet to make to make a sock and I'm going to stop talking about knitting now, because no one is interested.Instead, since I've had to move stuff to get the laptop set up where it was at on my bed, that means my sunglasses were there. So these are actually the ones I wear most of the time, not the blue ones in the previous, you know, video. And these actually -- 'cause look at the size of this piece, right? That's pretty big. It won't fit in my purse, without removing a lot of other stuff from it.If I wear these out, they usually wind up on my head, if I'm, like, you know, going in somewhere where I don't want to wear them, 'cause they're not really see through, they're kinda -- well, they're see through 'cause they're sunglasses, duh, but they're -- they're kinda dark, so um, wearing them into retail locations and such is not always a good idea. So they -- they usually live up here when they're not in my case, but um, I'm not sure how energy this is turning up to be. I must admit I'm a wee bit sleepy. Not really sleepy sleepy but I'm kinda -- I can be more up. And I had to have caffeine today to function.Speaking of which, you'll have likely read about the whole trip to Penney's yeah, already so -- I was told yesterday that I had to be ready to leave at one thirty, and we weren't going to be leaving 'til two, but I had to be out of the bathroom by one thirty, which usually takes me an hour to get all set and done in there, 'cause I'm a girl or something. I am a girl, I'm not something, I'm a girl, right.So anyway, I had -- I had been awoken or woken up at uh, about -- well, earlier this morning than I wanted to get up. I'm not going to tell you what time, 'cause it's pretty sad. Anyway, there was the industrial size riding lawnmower outside my window. There's a quiet thick expanse of grass out here, outside my window, and because it stretches on, for you know, quite you can tell with the slides here because I'm indicating my window so that you can see -- windows to my span, fun right? So there's a lot of grass out there.And uh, the mowing went on for forty five minutes before I could hear it, and I tried to go back to sleep and it didn't really work, until, like, you know, closer to the time where I needed to get up, which obviously, now that I've told you I had to be ready by one thirty, and it takes me an hour, you're guessing right, that I had to be up by at least twelve thirty to go in the shower, which I was up sooner than that because I had to get up, you know, and do some other stuff, but, anyway. So, I eventually fell back asleep and got about thirty minutes in, and woke up later than I had been planning, but it worked out more or less.Anyway, I had gotten sufficiently less sleep than I had planned on. I had gotten about an hour less than I had desired, so um, which when I'm sleeping about six hours anyway, I -- I need that, you know. Five -- five is kinda pushing it for functioning really well. Six, I can manage to swing, so I had gotten around five hours of sleep, and um, I didn't allot enough time to go pick up coffee, so I ended up with coffee from Dunkin' Donuts with two shots of espresso in it. At least they're doing espresso now, it helps save it some, but I'm admittedly a coffee snob and that was not my favoritest cup of coffee ever, so now I know.I allot extra time to go get coffee, 'cause I don't drink it often enough to have a supply at home, so I have to go procure it elsewhere. And I think I'm going to wrap this up now, 'cause this is getting longer than it needs to be and I'm not sure if I can, you know, assure quality control, so.Yeah, if you have a quest, leave them, I'll try to get to everything in the next one, 'cause I know I've missed some stuff from the previous one and back and forth.So, I love you all.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG35","﻿Now after you have all that all in the same bowl, you're gonna beat on low, with egg beaters obviously, and you're going to beat this mixture on low, until a dough begins to form. And once the dough forms, you'll know that it's ready when you squeeze the dough with your fingers and it sticks together.That means it's time to make the cookie shapes.﻿Hi, again and today I am gonna show you how to make some chocolate gem cookies -- and it's actually another Martha Stewart recipe, but it's really, really good so I thought I'd share it with you guys.And what you'll need for this recipe is two cups of flour, a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and the one I got was Hershey's because, I dunno, Hershey's was pretty sweet. Um, you'll also need one fourth cup of unsweetened cocoa powder so that's -- if I didn't say that, that's what you need and one fourth teaspoon of salt.And you'll also need a cup which is two sticks of unsweet-- unsalted butter at room temperature -- it has to be softened -- and three fourths cup of sugar and one teaspoon pure vanilla extract.Now that first step that we have to do in order to make these cookies is sift the flour and the salt and the cocoa powder -- remember three fourth cups -- all into one bowl to make this awesome powdery mixture. And I don't own a sifter, so I'm gonna kind of like, you know, go a little crazy and try to whisk it to you know -- a powder mixture. I hope this works, so -- it'll work I'm .So if you don't have a sifter you can just whisk it and with that always make a mixture. Just mix it together. Now the next thing you're gonna do is put your two sticks of unsweetened butter in this bowl and mix it until it's fluffy and like, on medium for about two minutes.After you've done mixing the butter together to make it all fluffy that's all you need. I've finished with a spoon because you're supposed to mix with a paddle, but I don't have a paddle so I finished with a spoon. And it's supposed to look kind of like this, really fluffy and soft.You add the three fourths cup of sugar and continue mixing for another two -","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG350","Hello, boys and girls and children of all ages. I think I did that wrong. Anyway to the point of the video, before I get this whole thing started explaining everything song so forth like I said on my last video, no matter, video before last. I just really want to say one thing. I should really start living up to what I say and not just what I do, no way.What I said in a few videos, don't care about your appearance, don't try to worry too much, I should try to live up to that. So, I'm going to let you all see my curly hair as it is normal, because I figure I might as well before I have it all cut off. I'll get to that here in a minute. So anyway, like I said in my sick blog, I have a few things to say. One, I was sick, so I can't -- I really could not, could not get up and do a blog like I would like to. Second, I have a plan. I'm going to grow my beard out for the New Year. I'm going to let it grow out every day; I should have recorded it yesterday, but I was, buh. So, I'm going to let it grow out now. It's growing out as of now, you can't tell because it takes time and anyways it will take -- point is I'm letting this grow out. I'm going to grow a full grown beard, so on, so long, so forth, weh. I'm messing up because I'm still out of it.Maybe it's the medication that's doing this to me. I had an idea pop in my head, yesterday, ow that hurts. I had an idea pop into my head yesterday, about what I can do to kind of help out with some new YouTubers who are just getting started. Like, um, I forgot his name -- Three sixteen Maloonics . I believe that's your all's name. I don't know how many owns this account, but I believe they're a partner, I can't tell. You said, you wanted me to give you a shout out, um, the thing is I don't give shout outs to many people, um, depending on who they are and if I know them since I've come here to YouTube. I know quite a few people since I've been here on YouTube, so they des -- ser -- ah --deserve a few shout outs, which I'm going to start doing here soon.See, this account was a XXXX account a while back, so I have a lot of people who enjoy XXXX on this account. So I'll give them a few shout outs to YouTube users who are below my subscription. Not below, I'm sorry, I'm off of it a bit today, who have less subscribers than me. I'm going to give them shout outs, because I believe they deserve it, well the ones I have subscribed to. So I'll start doing that I believe on every Friday, I'll just look around and take ten new videos, take about fifteen minutes of my time if it lasts that long every video, and I will probably, depending on those videos, I will give them a shout out. But now, I'm not giving shout outs to anyone who has over my sus -- over more subscribers than me, because they are already known apparently. Unless of course they have friend bops or add bops or just make bank accounts and just add themselves. I don't know how it goes. I'm not used to this whole cheating or hacking thing.I am used to purple combs, though. I go through these, what a month. I believe I said that I do one video, that's probably it. I'm going to start doing that and plus, as you can tell, it's -- I'm already looking rather odd with this. Well, technically I don't look odd as of yet, because if you all remember I had a goatee a while back and that goatee was annoying, and that goatee went away as soon as I had my hair kept. Along with this beard, I'll have a better haircut I hope and I hope I'll be able to straighten it. See, I don't like my hair curly for some reason. I can't stand it. It's something wrong with me. I have something mentally wrong with me, I'm trying to think what, gerbert, gerbert, gerbert, gerbert, but it doesn't come to mind and I can't think of the word I'm looking for, moron, moron, moron, moron, but that, I think, that's probably it and, um, I'm hoping I can start doing more interesting things that, um, would not be, um, boring, I guess, so some of you all, and I hope to get noticed more, um, what I'm trying to do is think of a video that people may like and they may watch and so forth and therefore it will get views and therefore I will get ratings and therefore I will be a idiot, but either way I'm trying to get out there, I'm at least trying in my own sense and my own style, apparently. I can't seem to get the hang of it yet, so either way, uh, this has been Blazy Alex video of the day, a blog day, a real video for once, not the just stand still image. Sorry about that again, I can't apologize enough. And, um, before I go I'm just happy that a few of my subscribers know about my, um, let's not -- my play view channel now, Blaze Outs, The Gamer, apparently they may not know or probably wouldn't want to know until I make a video called XXXX and they kind of say, hey he's doing let's play not let's placelace screws. Let's place our, uh, -- that's enough of that. I'm going to go ahead and close this video out with a have fun with it.","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG351","﻿Ooh -Fire, so burn and feed it.No, that's -- that was like the only good thing I did throughout the whole game. Another sexist stereotype: only gay guys can be cheerleaders.Hey. Okay, so I'm going to get straight to the point 'cause um, I don't have time to do my usual intro -- whatever.Ha ha. Rup, rup, rup, rup. It's long -So, now what I was going to say? Right, so the difference between guys and girls. What can girls do that guys can't do and what can guys do that girls can't do? If that makes sense.So first off, sexual jokes. When a guy says a sexual joke, it's gross, but hilarious, right? Because that's how guys are. They're gross and hilarious, but when a girl says a sexual joke, it's just gross. And depending on how vulgar the sexual joke is, it can even make her look like a slut. And it sucks, too, because I know a lot of hilarious sexual jokes, but, you know, I'm just not in the mood to be a ho bag right now.Another thing um, guys have it easy when they need to go to the bathroom. And you know what I'm talking about. Okay, so one time my cousin went on a field trip and it was a long bus ride. There was no bathroom on the bus and the bus driver didn't want to make a quick stop. And his friend who's a guy had to piss so bad. He had to piss so bad that his bladder had gas. No, his bladder didn't really have gas. Just a metaphor I made up to show you how bad he needed to piss. All right, so he needed to pee so bad and lucky for him, he had an empty water bottle with him. Yeah, this is a little weird and awkward, I guess, buy hey! He did it, you know? Uh, a girl can't do that.Basically, guys can just pee anywhere. They can pee in the bushes, the trees, pinecones, whatever, you know? I mean, I guess girls can do that too, but we don't really like squatting in public. Maybe for yoga, but not -- huh uh, no. And then, toilet paper. You expect us to use a leaf? No, okay? There could be ladybugs one that thing. You know, roly polies, or whatever? That's -- that's yucky.What can girls do that guys can't do? Um, we can give birth and go through menustration -- woo hoo! Okay, so I'm not going too in depth about menustration because I know a lot of guys feel uncomfortable talking about or even hearing the word menustration -- menustration -- menustration. But you know what? Suck it up, buttercup. The words men and straight are in menustration for a reason because you straight men need to suck it up, too. And that's what she said.And uh, guys can't give birth either. Aw, shucks. Yeah, guys are never going to know what it feels like to give birth unless they have fallopian tubes or something.Okay, last thing. Uh, sex and stereotypes. That stereotype that girls suck at sports or girls can't play football -See, short guys can be cheerleaders, too. All right, well I gotta go 'cause it's spring break and I'm supposed to go to a barbecue. I can't leave, though, until I finish my laundry and I have freaking like three baskets of laundry that I need to do and fix my bed and everything and -- I'm procrastinating.I'll right, so I guess I'll TTYL.","High","Low","High"

Well, yeah, if you could make me some sort of a, like a punishment countdown video detailing all my punishments, that would be so great, because I am so not organized and, and I will forget. Um, so I need you to remind me what they are. Um, and, and also detail my new ones and then that will catch all the viewers up to date and then they will know what we're talking about when we say punishment.

"VLOG355","﻿Hi, XXXX. So you posed the question of which is worse, chickens that need chicken TV just to keep themselves from killing each other and hurting themselves or no chickens at all? Because if we stopped eating chicken that are raised in factory farms, they would probably go extinct because there are no more uh, chickens that were, you know, able to live in the wild.I think, as a vegetarian for the last year and a half, and as an animal rights person, that while it's a terrible option, chickens going extinct is probably better for the chickens. Because a life lived in captivity and in those horrible conditions is no better than having no life at all and as one of the commenters on your video said, a life that doesn't exist can't suffer.So as terrible as it sounds to say that I would prefer there be no chickens in the world because chickens are kind of cool. Um, it would be better for the chickens because they would not be suffering in the way that we make them suffer.I think that it's great that is person has found a way to lessen to the suffering of chickens in factory farms, because they really do suffer horrible, horrible tragedies like getting their beaks cut, and you know, being stuffed in cages where they can't even move. And they peck at themselves and each other and there's so much disease and disgusting things going on there.But I think the bigger issue is that we put these chickens in those deplorable conditions and we put lots of other animals like pigs, and cows, and sheep, and everything else that we eat just for ourselves in these terrible conditions just so we can feed ourselves in these vastly growing numbers. And I think we should try to find alternatives to that.So yes, in response to your -- your question, I do believe that it would be better for the chickens just to live out their lives without suffering and possibly go extinct. Because I think that people need to understand the consequences of what we do to the animals in our environment and to our environment itself.Because as my adorable little sticker says, they are not nuggets.","Low","Low","High"

"VLOG358","﻿Hey. I literally just hung up the phone on my interview for Spring twenty ten and I don't know what to think. Um, normally I really love interviewing. Not love it but I don't mind that part of the process. But phone interviewing where you can't see the other person's face is odd. It was a weird experience for me.So she called like three minutes late. I was like sitting on my bed just like staring at my phone from like three twenty exactly, um, because my interview was at three thirty. It lasted exactly half an hour. It would have been shorter and because I almost did not get invited to audition, which I would have cried. We went over my application, we talked about some general -- why do you want to work for Disney? She said I sounded like I had been a couple of times and what my favorite park was.If she had to talk more about my favorites, I'd be like, well I love Magic Kingdom but Illuminations is my favorite nighttime spectacular and my favorite ride is Splash Mountain. But in Epcot it -- I don't even know what my favorite in Epcot is. Illumination, um, that's not a ride. Um, and my favorite MGM Hollywood Studios ride is Tower of Terror and in Evil Kingdom, I love Expedition Everest and Kilimanjaro Safari. Then we would have talked for like two hours, so probably for the best though and we talked -- she was like, what's your favorite resort? I was like Pioneering because like my dad likes the art club and he is the one paying.She's like, I see you’ve retail experience, would you like to add quick food service, beverage and merchandise? I was like; I felt bad declining to do either. So I was like, I guess merchandise would be okay. She asked me what my role was -- she didn’t ask me my top three. She asked me what I thought I was most qualified for and so I was like, attractions and concierge? Because I -- compared to the other applicants I don't have the super extensive dance and theatre background. I have passion and a bit of a dream. I know a lot of people have their dreams but I just -- it just didn’t jump to me, as I am qualified to do this. I think I am qualified but it was kind of an awkwardly worded question for me. I think I qualify for face. I don't think I qualify face, I'm sorry. Hi poppy. Okay, no that was -- scratch that.So I said attractions, because I love public speaking and concierge because I love guest service and I have a pretty extensive knowledge of Walt Disney World. So we talked about merchandise. She asked one question about that. She asked a couple about attractions and how comfortable I am on spieling, which I am very comfortable, as you can tell. We talked about concierge quite a bit, which was really to me because like I said, that's one of my top choices. I was pleasantly surprised about how much we spoke about the concierge seeing that I'm not a hospitality user.Um, then she was like, do you have any questions for me? I was like, can I go . She was like, oh you have to be invited to get the [] and I was like, oh, I can totally do this and -- great, I was freaking out that I would not get invited to the utter shine. She was like, just know it's very competitive. I was like, I know I know. I was like, but I was Clifford in Barnes and Noble once and I am getting involved in theatre and please please please invite me. So I guess that worked. I didn’t get to wish her a magical day. I kind of wish I had, um, but on to the audition which I need to rock.I don't know guys. I am sorry this blog is so long, I'm just -- my heart is still racing. I'm -- oh wow. I am hoping for concierge or attractions and I am getting really pumped about spring twenty ten. I'm going to be bummed if it doesn’t work out. Bye guys. I'm going to Euro Disney Company, I'm excited. But it's pouring rain again. My hair does not like this weather at all. Hey, bye.Some imagination huh?","High","High","High"
"VLOG359","Hello. So, um, I have some news to tell you about today. Um, it's a project my friend Sophie and I are currently undertaking. Um, it was her idea; she wanted to raise money for St. John's Ward in Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin, Dublin. Um, it's the oncology ward; um, cancer ward, if you don't know. So, um, I pulled this suggestion after she had a couple of ideas as well, which I think are probably still gonna move ahead. But, um, this is the one that I think requires the most organization.So, um, public for poems. We're putting together a book of poetry called, well provisional title, eh, XXXX. Um, we have a set number of themes. We have poems for children, um, poems for children, love poems, poems about friendship. Uh, sad poems, uh, well you know sad -- eh, and seasonal poems. So obviously spring, summer, autumn, winter. Poems that are related to them or -- um, we have a designer/person who's going to organize the layout of the book, um, and make it nice and pretty and that is my cousin, the lovely XXXX. Uh, she volunteered her services, didn't have to ask her. It's great, isn't it.Um, deadline for poems is December fifteenth. We're hoping to get a release in February. We're going to be posting through lulu. com; self publishing site. Um, but there will be orders available. If you know me personally, as in, you know, face to face, you're able to talk to me; um, I will be doing bulk orders that way. Um, because it'll save you money on postage and packing, we'll just have to charge you the cost of the book.Um, so yeah, that -- there'll be a link to the blog, which -- tonight is Tuesday the seventeenth. I'll be setting that up tonight, um, and so it will be going up on Wednesday the eighteenth. Um, there will also be a link to the Facebook page that, em, uh, Sophie set up. It's under Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin fundraising page. Um, I think the blog should be about the poetry book, so there is a running order based on what's happening.And it may -- well, don't hold me to this, but it may be an annual thing. But, if not try to get your poem in, as soon as possible. Um, we will be going first come, first serve -- we'll be choosing this based on what poems we like best, or poems who can work best together. And, please specify what theme that you're submitting the poem to, so that it makes it easier for us to do our job, because we have -- how many themes? Eight themes and we're hoping to have, maybe eighty to a hundred poems, so you know please make our job a little easier by specifying what you're submitting the poem for.Um, there will be an email address, all sorts of stuff, on the blog post and on the Facebook page and I will add that to the sidebar whenever it is created.Okay, um, so best of luck writing your poems and please submit December fifteenth. Thank you, bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG36","Mmm. It is so freaking hot here, my armpits smell like a at the concert. There, I said it dad. And it's not as hot as Darwin but at least in Darwin most people have air conditioners and you can sleep at night without sweating. At the moment I'm working on a remix for Witlee, it's a competition and if I win I get twelve months worth of free entry into all due process concerts or whatever, I don't know what it is. But, I'm going to win it. I'm competitive now. I decided that yesterday. We'll see if I can eat this ice cream before it'll melt. Can I eat it up? I see a lot of, um, those commercials on TV for ABC three starting on December fourth. It makes me feel sad but also very happy for people who got the jobs. It will be awesome. If there any ABC three people who are watching, I'm in Sydney and I need a job. Yeah, I actually live two streets down from the ABC building and I go past there every day on my way to school and go huh. I have thought of infiltrating the place wearing a lobster suit but then my sister told me lobsters are dangerous looking so why not dress as a bear. Although I think bears are rather dangerous, depending on the kind of bear. My last bit of ice cream. That was good, that was really good, actual gelato in fact. I got it from the farmers market across the road. Why not listen to the remix, I'll show it to you. Lets rock. Play it please. . We are here/it seems we are always marching/ it seems dark like here/Nothing ever seems so clear so clear .  Well that wasn't a real phone call. I was just making the whole thing but, you know. You thought it was real didn't you? Anyway let me know what you think of the remix, it's just like about a minute of it but I really don't know what to do next. I have a feeling that's the end of the song but I made it first so I really don't know what to choose for the beginning. I'm good making things from end to front. No it's not. You may have noticed that there's no what's on anti news things today, I feel lazy today so there's not going to be one. There wasn't one last week though so there's not going to be one this week. But there will be one next week, maybe. Or I must just have one special one for it, if something completely ridiculous happens in the town in that time. Like that time that there was a three hundred person brawl in Katarina Square . I actually went and looked it up and it was only thirty people but my sister told me it was three hundred people. I would hold her to that because it sounds way more epic. . Yeah that was totally awesome.","High","High","High"
"VLOG360","﻿Hi, it's been a long time, yeah. Do you ever notice that I do that a lot? Yeah, um, I was going through my videos and I realized that I haven't done the kind of blog that I like doing since July. I haven't made one of those blogs where I just chit chat to you about everything that crosses my mind as it crosses my mind. I like doing that it just gets everything off the chest. So I decided okay, it might be time. And have you noticed anything? The camera angle is, like, different because my whole desk is in a different spot. I've got, like, a log here to smash my head on if ever the temptation over comes me or something, yeah no. Also I've got the fuzzy hair now. You see the story behind that is that I wanted a body perm so just to have a little bit of volume in the hair and it turned out something like this, you know, chka chka chk, a little too curly to my liking. It was accidental, but you live with it. Me -- I went and paid like money to have to flatten my hair every morning like people do that I never had to do, and I went and paid money to have to dry my hair for like a half hour before it's nearly completely dry, which I never had to do. It -- it -- it will go back to normal eventually. Hopefully, I think.Also I've changed jobs since the last time. I think I may have mentioned that before, but I don't know so I'm just going to repeat myself up. Naw, I must not have because I started like three weeks ago. I work in this little gift shop. It's in the middle of this mall in my small town and I have never realized how many weird people live in my town. Its ridiculous -- yeah I'll just hang out at the mall -- you just see the weirdest freaking people pass by. You're just like, whoa, where the hell did that person come from? What were they doing? I really want to shirt, the one that says, I thought we were dancing, my bad, that would be like awesome dude, just fits my personality so much. That would be awesome.I've been watching an insane amount of movies lately. Hah, oh, do you remember about this time last year I made a video about turning twenty and I was like super panicked -- for all you old subscribers there-- I was like super panicked about being twenty, I was like good lord I'm going to be twenty, yeah I'm turning twenty one soon. Twenty didn't turn out so bad, I mean I still have a few days to go. Actually I've got a little while to go still, about a month or so, a bit more than a month. But hey, this far into the twentieth year was quite good. Maybe it all will go all down hill from here but so far it went good. Year of change, year of change.So yeah, tons of good stuff going on, good job, good stuff, uh, uh, the other job, good stuff also, not being at the old job, freaking good stuff and maybe getting this internship, most likely, probably. I am really trying like to tone it down so that I'm not super disappointed if I don't get what I want, you know. I'm pretty sure I'm getting it though, so that like freaking awesome and I hope a nice visit for my birthday which is happening soon, get like, friend visiting from Europe for two weeks and then, and then -- oh yeah, things are going good. And I'm hopefully going to be making more of these because um, I miss it. I don't know about you guys but I miss it. When you guys play you're like, fuck, more of this stuff going on and I will be like, ha, ha, ha ha, more of this stuff going on. Yeah, okay, I think I've -- I think -- I think that's enough. I shall see you again in July. No, hopefully we'll see you before July -- yeah, before July.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG361","Hey there YouTube. I've just -- I've had a very rocky week -- rocky week, sorry, even I can't talk but, um, I just want to turn this video on because I want to alert the new AT&T and iPhone customers -- customers out there, about losing your iPhone. One, I don't recommend it. Two, I don't recommend it. Three, I don't recommend it. Why? Because you'll be charged up your ass and this is only for like the first year and a half customers here, before you get the upgrade so you can get this phone for a cheaper if you get another one on -- on your same account. So let's just -- let's just take a little story that happened to me this week. You all know I went to and somehow the planes just love my iPods and my iPhones because each time I leave there I don't come back with them. So they just -- so they just take it away from me. So, when I got back to my house I -- I was you know, looking over my stuff and seeing what was here and what wasn't and what I had to throw away. And I basically noticed I didn't have my iPhone with me. So I thought maybe I left it in my friend's car. So I call him. He looks -- not there. Now I panic. Um, and that's when I could not find it and that's when I realized that it was gone. I did ask my friend to take another good look at it, but it's not happening. So here I was, now without a phone, again. This is not the first time something bad happened to my iPhone, by the way, never jump into a pool with one. Um, so I'm with another iPhone, so all right, we'll wait until, you know, around Wednesday to get the new phone.So I go to the apple store on Wednesday and since there is no insurance on the iPhone, or at least the three G S model. Um, you can -- you're pretty much going to be paying out of your -- out of your pocket to get this new iPhone.So here it is, new iPhone with a new case, in case, I'll review it sometime. Um, I'm sure you've heard of all the in cases now. But, um, we go in there and they tell me to do that, uh, early, um, step and all that extra stuff that you do before you get a -- before you get a, um, new phone. So I do that and then I look at the prices. four hundred, five hundred, four ninety nine, five ninety nine, six ninety nine. So the UGS model, of course which is the most expensive, the one that has the thirty two gigabytes. Six ninety nine. Do you understand the numbers? Six hundred and ninety nine dollars and ninety nine cents for a new iPhone. If you happen to have the same plan and buy a new iPhone. What the fuck? What the fuck? So, um, yeah. So that's when I -- me and my Mom took it through a shit store and, um, we went out of the store. We were looking for the HGV store and near the same area and they told us, yeah, that's -- that's the way it is and you almost just lost a customer. Um, now I do cancel my -- that's when I cancelled my account so I can get the phone cheaper by going to my mom's account. Now normally I wouldn't do that but, you know, I needed a phone and I don't want to use what we call a dumb phone. A dumb phone is like a normal -- normal cell phone. So I -- I did everything I could to get a new iPhone which I did. And, um, it's very bittersweet.So my story here and I'm -- I'm not blaming Apple or AT and T. Um, I was at first because, you know, I was so mad about the price and me losing my phone and it was just a mess. But I'm not blaming AT&T and Apple. They're gonna run out of business. But still, to jack up the prices to six ninety nine on the same account. Are you kidding me? And then offer an upgrade about a year and half later? That's a little shitty but, um, but it's not something I don't expect from Apple. I mean, I love Apple and everything but, you know, they have their bad things, you know.But I -- so this is just a quick video to tell you to watch out for your iPhone, 'cause you don't want to lose this in your first year on a contract with them. To break it and maybe go on someone else's plan and get a new phone, you don't want that. So I advise not to go on another person's plan unless it's a family member. That is the only time I will -- I could say, oh yeah. 'cause I did it. I'm not going to blame you if you don't do it and now.So -- so that's my story. Um, I did just get ODST. Um, I'm friends with the campaign first and I'll accept more invites for friends 'cause I do want to try out fire fighting.So -- so, yeah, that's my story guys. Um, work starts next week so videos will probably become a little bit more scarce. Now I'll try to do a video once in a while. I guess it will work out when I'm not at work. So I got the life thing and a new car which I'm gonna show and I want to post a new video for you guys. I just got a new car. It's a Mitsubishi Lancer GTS two thousand and eight, so it's a very nice car. So um, just, uh, just be weary of losing your iPhone and, you know, all that stuff that happens when, you know, you lose a phone. I mean, losing a phone is tough but, um, but, you know, I mean, lose an i -- like an iPhone type of phone, it's gonna be even tougher. And AT and T and Apple don't make it any easier on your first year. Customer loyalty, yeah. Right now, I'm running out of stuff so I'm just cutting this video now, um, so yeah, , subscribe guys. Um and I'll talk to you soon. Take it easy.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG363","When I was thirteen years old, I compiled a list of one thousand and sixty three to do when you are bored. This notebook holds that list. And obviously, by watching this video, you're guaranteeing yourself a life of no boredom, ever, forever.Number one, draw a picture of the stupidest thing in the room you're in. Number two, find a cookbook and make the strangest flipping recipe in it. Number three, call your grandma. Number four, go outside and lie in the grass. Number five, name your future kids. Number six, challenge your brother, mom, grandma, or whoever's around to a game of Monopoly or a relay race. Seven, read this entire list. Eight, read this entire list again. Nine, keep reading this list until you're so bored that you stopped doing numbers seven through nine on this list. Number ten, take out some pots and pans, big spoons and bowls and bang on them. Number eleven, blow bubbles. Number twelve, call someone you haven't talked to in a very long time.So, I'm getting bored reading this list, so I'm gonna skip to um, some numbers and interests such as number forty seven, which is look up the word dictionary in the dictionary to see if it's there. And the best part of number forty seven is that there's a little star that I put there and then if you follow the star to the bottom of the page, it says just in case you were dying to know, it is.Five hundred and forty five, go on a quest to obtain Santa Claus' autograph.So, five hundred and forty seven is laugh when your dad seriously believes he strongly resembles George Washington. I have no recollection of my dad ever believing he seriously resembled, um, George Washington, or strongly resembled George Washington, or in any way resembled George Washington. Yeah, so I don't know where I got that from, but you guys, if you wanna laugh when your dad believes he looks like George Washington, go for it.Five hundred and fifty eight, count your parents' gray hairs. This could take a while.Six hundred and seventy nine, make a sculpture of your crush out of play dough.Seven hundred and twenty six, snort.Seven hundred and thirty six, open and close drawers, randomly.So number seven hundred and fifty four is go trick or treating if it's not Halloween, and, uh, it's obviously written in somebody else's handwriting, which I think is funny. Obviously, seven hundred and fifty four was not original.Seven hundred and seventy seven, do everything on this list.Uh, number eight hundred and twenty is write a book about Scrabble, which is very random, and strange because I'm very obsessed with Scrabble, as of now. I don't remember every really liking Scrabble when I was thirteen.So eight hundred and sixty three is make a tossed salad and 864 is toss a tossed salad somewhere.Pretty brilliant, nine hundred and seven, say random words in a random order in a way that people think you are saying something really philosophical. And then I wrote, or whatever that word is. But you were really just saying random words in a random order.Number nine hundred and seventeen, glue two paper plates together, tell people it is a spaceship and count the weird looks. Take pictures of the people that believe you, 'cause that is kinda weird, cool, or sad. I can't decide.Nine hundred and forty one, tape your face, and I put a little star after face, and if you follow the star down, it says okay, not your face literally, but a picture or something. Anyway, tape your face on a one dollar bill, because you rule.Nine hundred and seventy eight, make a happy list. Type up a bunch of stuff that makes you happy, give it a pretty border. Print it out and put it somewhere where you will see it a lot, and remember, don't worry, be happy.One thousand and sixteen, go to an art gallery and tell people that you appreciate good art, they probably won't care, but it is something to do.One thousand twenty six, walk around your block wearing something kinda weird, like a bathing suit, boots, and a bathrobe, see if anyone notices.","High","High","High"
"VLOG364","What's up, internet? XXXX here. So, many of you will have switched to summer time last night, and if you're anything like me, then you'll always spend a little moment thinking, ooh, do I change the clock from two to three, or back from three to two? And there's an interesting little phrase to help you remember that and that's in spring, spring forward and in fall, fall back. And that always helps to remember, you know, when you lose an hour, and when you gain an hour. Although, I still haven't really figured out the use of summertime, whatever, and such a little trick is called a mnemonic, or however you pronounce it. M and an N in a row, I don't know who thought of that.There are actually a number of these tricks, floating around, you know, helping you remember stuff. And I find them very useful because I am lazy that way. For example, one of those tricks is, you know, when you screw in, a screw, um, which way do you turn? And, uh, there's a trick, lefty loosey, righty tighty. So, if you look at the top of a screwdriver, turning it to the right will tighten the screw, and turning it to the left will loosen the screw. That's pretty practical.If you're ever in a ship or a boat, you'll know that there's no left and right, there's always portside and starboard side, right? But which one is which? Here's another interesting mnemonic phrase to help you out with. Port is always left at sea, but never at dinner. You know, pertaining to port wine. So, if you're facing the front of the boat, port is left side, starboard is the right side.Here's another one that I like. When you set up a chess board, right, do you set it up this way, or that way? And, you actually set it up this way, why? Because, white is right. Got it?There also used to be this nice phrase to help you remember, you know, the planets in the solar system, as seen from the sun, and that used to be, My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas. You know, with each first letter of a word, pertaining to the first letter of a planet, you know, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and so on, and so forth. Of course, back when I was in school, Pluto was still a planet, and -- I am really starting to show my age there. You know, when I was your age sonny, the solar system actually had one more planet than it does now? Well anyway, so, I don't know if there is a new mnemonic phrase for that. Maybe, like, My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Nothing. I don't know. Um, yeah, but, you know, things like that happen and help in real life. You know, I'm not even going to go into all the details of my private phrases, like, you know, stalactites, whatever, but if you have any mnemonic phrases that you'd like to share with the rest of us, please do. Thanks a lot. Bye bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG365","Hey, it's Friday! And as you can see behind me, it is definitely winter. It's so cold, but considering the theme, I felt it was appropriate to tape outside. I wouldn't exactly call myself team winter, because I can't really pick a favorite season, but I do like winter and I'm glad it's not like this year round, but I have fun when it comes, you know, just for a few months and stuff. Because, you know, it's kinda fun, even though it's freezing. And also, I'm a pretty big fan of Christmas music and Christmas in general and ice skating and Christmas movies and Christmas. And it's also fun to go sledding with my friends and I can't think of a better way to spend an evening than reading by a fireplace when you can see, like, snow outside and it's just, like, super toasty in the house, but it's like, mmm, the best. Oh, and hot chocolate. Hot chocolate, hot chocolate.I'm not really sure what else to talk about when it comes to winter, but I thought maybe favorite Christmas movies might be a good topic of conversation. And I think you girls should answer this question too, in maybe your videos next week or something. Just tell us what some of your favorite Christmas movies are and commentors {sic}, you should leave me comments and tell me what some of your favorite Christmas movies are. Some of mine are -- oh hello, hee hee hee, my dad came outside because I'm taping this later in the day, after I got back from work instead of taping it in the morning, like I usually do. Oops. My favorite Christmas movies are: I really like While You Were Sleeping, I love It's a Wonderful Life, I really like The Muppet Christmas Carol, because it's awesome and it has awesome songs in it and I get them stuck in my head and it's fantastic. And A Christmas Story, and Elf, Elf -- so funny, best Christmas movie ever, except not really the best one ever, because I like a lot of Christmas movies, but it's one of my favorites. It's good.I really can't think of anything else to talk about and it is cold out here, so I think that I'm just going to make this video really short. So sorry if it's really, really short and Megan , I'll see you on Monday. Stay sweet.","High","High","High"
"VLOG366","I'm here to talk about a very special organization, called the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. This is especially important to me for one important reason -- I have Ulcerative Colitis, and I'm gonna talk to you about it. This is me. This is XXXX of the XXXX. XXXX and I have one thing in common, we both have Ulcerative Colitis. Hank and I are completely different people. We live in different states, we're different ages, and we live completely different lives. But we do have one thing in common -- we both have Ulcerative colitis. I've had it since I was fourteen. Hank's had it since he was twenty three. Ulcerative Colitis is not a fun disease - there is very little you can do about it, except for medicate. Lots of medication. Pills, pills, pills, pills, tic taks.So the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, or the CCFA, works to help aid research into finding a cure for Ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. As of right now the only real solution to Crohn's or Colitis is something called an ileectomy. An ileectomy's a procedure where they take out the diseased part of the colon. The only problem with that is it's not always successful. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad procedure. I have a friend who had Crohn's disease, then he had an ileectomy, and now lives a completely normal life. In fact, he's getting married tonight. The problem is the people who it doesn't work for. Sometimes they never get back to normal and their bodies are completely different for the rest of their lives, and it's pretty bad. So let's get back on topic, the CCFA - I'm supporting it because it's important to me.This is a foundation that can make a massive difference for millions and millions of people around the world who have - live with daily pain from Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, like Hank and I. Okay, now if you have no I - every year for the past three, thousands and thousands of people have been making Project for Awesome videos. A Project for Awesome video is a video where you choose a charity, and you make a video supporting it. Then you go and you find other Project for Awesome videos. You rate it, you comment it, and you favorite it until you - your fingers fall off. Hopefully by doing this we can trick YouTube's algorithm, so the main pages are just Project for Awesome videos. At the end of the Project for Awesome, the top promoted charities get tons and tons of money donated to them.So in the end, for one day YouTube's not about cats jumping in and out of boxes, or about Kanye being a jerk - it's about raising money for charity and making the world suck a little less. So rate, comment, and favorite this video and other Project for Awesome videos, and try to make a difference. By the way, Hank's on my wall.I have a complicated relationship with the distal portion of my large intestine, also known as the colon. I started feeling kinda shitty when I turned twenty three and then the pain got worse and worse every day, and the days turned into weeks. I finally went to see the doctor and I pooped into a cup, and then a few weeks after that he stuck this camera up my butt, and the camera was in a tube, and the tube it pumped out air, so that my colon would inflate and they could look around in there. When I woke up the doctor was looking at my chart. I called his attention to me with a fifteen minute fart, and he said Son I hate to tell you, cause I know you're not gonna like this, but they got a name for what you have and it's called Ulcerative colitis. And in those seven syllables, there's a mess of shitty news -- it's likely that you've had your last healthy feeling poos.It's like road rash on your colon, you'll bleed -- it'll hurt, and no one knows what causes it and there is no cure. And yeah, your chances of cancer have gone up a bit, but colon cancer's curable if you keep your eye on it. But what's mostly what will piss you off is how much you're gonna pay -- I know you're not insured and you'll probably stay that way. See insurance companies hate to deal with sick folks like you. They don't like taking money from folks they might have to give it back to. And your pills are gonna cost you both your arms and at least one leg - I suggest you go to Canada, get on your knees, and beg. Because here the costs are as high as the market conveyer. Take a barrel and compare it with soiled underwear. I sat there on that bed and thought about how I used to like to pooh, I thought that maybe there was a mistake, how could this be true?I asked the doctor, pleading, begging if he was sure, and if he was, how could it be that there was no cure. The only cure we have, he said, is to take the whole thing out, and then to get your movements out we install a little spout. I told him that I'd rather take a thousand thousand dollar pills. He agreed and sent me home with similar sounding bills, and now really all I've learned, besides the importance of fiber, is the health care system's more screwed up than a fifty year old Fred subscriber.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG367","Hey guys. I could have been either one of those things for Halloween, but, um, Halloween's not really, like, a -- a really big thing in Belgium, so we didn't really celebrate it. Um, we had sort of a Halloween movie night and we wanted to watch horror movies.Ah, so Reese's girlfriend Vanessa; she came over and we watched, ah, Let the Right One In. And, we had this Halloween horror night but it was kind of a fail, 'cause well the movie is -- it's a really pretty movie. It's a Swedish movie but it wasn't, like, horrorish and I fell asleep. But yeah, we had a cool Halloween night.Um, so this is sort of a response to a Tyler Oakley, uh, clip, ah, that I saw, which I really loved. Ah, he asked for pictures or clips, uh, of your Halloween costumes. I don't really have, like, you know, those slutty costumes; I don't have those. But I have cool masks, right? Okay, so these could have been my Halloween costumes, but then, you know, nothing happened.Oh, also Tyler Oakley, um, in his clip; he talked about overalls and how he wanted to, like, be able to like wear them in public. He wanted them to become acceptable again and I totally support that. Because, I have two pairs of overalls and I never get to wear them, because I'm afraid people will laugh at me. But, I think they're really cool. Aren't they?Ain't nobody around. I'm just sittin' here by myself with next to nothing on my mind. Yeah. Ain't nobody around. I'm just sittin' here by myself with -Anyway, um, that's the clip for today; overalls and Halloween. You know, it should -- should be good, right? So, I hope you like the clip. I hope you had a great weekend and I see y'all soon. Peace out. I just said y'all; does that make me, like, a bit of, like, hillbilly, like. Bye y'all.Ain't nobody around.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG368","Hi. Um, so I kind of have some bad news that our channel is going to be put on hiatus for now because not very many people are able to blog. Um, yeah, I don't know if or when or if we'll ever, you know, conjoin back together again -- I don't even know if we're technically on hiatus or not.I know I would still like to blog, and XXXX and XXXX might still be able to -- or like, willing to blog and stuff, so I'm not sure if that's all gonna continue or if we're gonna -- I don't think we're gonna start a new channel, but we might.And, I don't know. XXXX and XXXX, I miss you guys. Even though I still talk to you all the time, I just, I miss you. I miss your videos. And XXXX, if you're watching, I miss you too.So, okay, guess that's all for now. I think, I still might continue to make a video on here, just to say hey, what's up, you know, and all that stuff. So, I'm gonna try to keep it beating, the heart of our channel I mean, for now.Maybe it's like Frankenstein -- we'll make it come to life again later, woo.

"VLOG369","Okay, so, I'm really, really wet right now and it's kind of weird for me to be videotaping this, but I have to say it, I have to say it. So, it's just great. Uh, so, I'm really wet right now, 'cause it's raining outside, and that it's raining outside, but you might be able to hear it, but probably not. It's like super duper rain, but pouring, and it's fucking pouring outside. And I'm really wet, and I was on my porch, and I was dancing around in the rain and it was so fun. It was like, ridiculously fun. I was dancing around and I'm like, oh, I'm so wet and I don't care, and I'm freezing cold, but I don't care, and there's like, water pouring down my face, but I don't care. I just -- I don't care about anything right now. I'm just so happy. Just like, I don't care who's staring at me because I'm dancing in the rain. I don't care how weird people would think I am, because I think this is the -- one of the most beautiful days I've ever seen. I don't care what people think of me. I don't care what happens now. I can fucking face anything, and I don't care, and I'm so happy and I'm fucking wet. And I don't know, its just like, uh, like, it's like what do you keep trying to tell me. You keep trying to tell me to not care what other people think about me; not care what I do; just do what I want to, and just be who I am and just be happy with who I am, and know, that no matter what I do, I'm gonna be okay. And right now, when I -- when I was out there dancing, when I was just getting drenched, when I was standing there staring at the sky, having the water fall down on me, I knew that I was gonna be okay and I knew that everything was gonna be okay. And I don't know, I just feel pretty amazing right now.So I'm videotaping it because uh, it's kind o' like, um, gonna be kind o' weird to call you right now and tell you about this. And I don't even know if I'm ever gonna let you see this, I don't know. I'm just so happy right now and so wet; and I'm shouting and I'm probably freaking out my dogs. But, oh, my God, oh, this is so amazing. I feel so amazing right now. I don't know. I just feel like, it doesn't matter what happens. It doesn't matter what anyone does. It doesn't matter if I leave. It doesn't matter. I -- don't know, nothing really matters, it's just, I'm me, and I'm dancing in the rain and I'm so happy. It's just this moment, this moment, it's just amazing. And I'm really -- it doesn't make sense, but I don't care. I don't care what people think about me, really, because I'm so happy right now. And I don't care that I'm shaking my laptop, because I'm just ecstatic and kind o' crazy, and crazy, but I don't care. And I can't stop laughing, which is kind of weird I know, uh, it's like, I'm standing out there in the rain dancing and laughing. I'm like, this is weird. But whatever, it's awesome! And I'm also talking really funny, and I'm kind o' shaking right now 'cause of the cold, 'cause it's super wet. Like, you can't tell with this shirt 'cause its black, but its pretty wet, too. And my hair is soaking wet, like, my hair was completely dry before. This is all from the rain. Oh, my God! Oh yeah, I'm really happy and excited and I feel like I've had a sudden realization, even though all I've been doing is dancing in the rain. All right, I feel kind of amazing.So, thank you for like, all the times you've told me to be myself, and all the times you told me how amazing I am, and all the times you told me not to worry about what other people think, or not to worry about what's gonna happen. Because you're right! You're right, you're right, I shouldn't -- you're right. I'm awesome, you're right. I don't need to worry about all the stuff and I don't need to care. And like, it's the simple things that make you so happy, like dancing in the rain. So thank you so much. And I know that I'm gonna be okay, and I know that you're gonna be okay and I know that just everything's gonna be okay. And in the end, we'll all end up happy. So thank you.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG37","Yeah, as implied, I'm now officially one year old, on YouTube anyway -- I'm thirteen in real life. Um, and I just wanted to say that it's really weird. Not really. But, it's kinda of cool to know that I'm, in a sense, a kind of veteran and I know how things work on YouTube. Not really, but -- 'cause I've only made eleven videos, but it's -- it's kinda cool -- one year. Yay. By the way, in case you haven't noticed, this video is -- in my opinion anyway - significantly better from the other videos, partially because of my wonderful new lamp light. Okay, this might -- this is gonna take a little bit of effort. All right. Random book shelf, I know. Yeah, it's wonderful, OAR poster, but that lamp -- and it totally lights up this room great, instead of my mini desk lamp, um, and I like it. But I don't know where it's from; don't ask me. Um, but I really -- woah, sorry -- like the lamp and I hope that it will -- Jesus, sorry -- stick around for -- at least for a couple more videos. Um, yay lamp.Yeah. I'm making this video for a total of three reasons -- two -- three? We'll see. Three. I'm gonna go with three, three for now. Three reasons. One, because it's summer. But, with summer, comes, as all children -- high schoolers -- kids know, summer work. And this year, instead of just getting to read whatever I want, which is -- by the way, now totally seems great -- um, I actually have required reading. And I have --yeah. And I have three books. One, two, three. Three -- three books. I have the wonderful -- one second -- A Distant Mirror by Barbra W. Tuchman, which I am currently not even close to half way, which is how much I have to read. Um, I would recommend this book if you are either a) a historian, or b) a social studies teacher. Otherwise, I'd pretty much steer clear of it. It's quite hefty; I don't know it's weight in pounds. Um, but it's quite big, and I don't carry it around with me. I read it here at my desk. Um, and it -- it's -- it's interesting. It's really in depth, like I really have a lot of facts that I didn't know, and now I do.Book two, How to read Literature Like a Professor by Thomas C. Foster. This book, significantly better. Um, in all seriousness, it's actually really interesting. Um, I am going into an advanced, uh, English and Social Studies course, so hence reading literature like a professor. And, um, he makes it really, really interesting, and teaching me about symbols, and -- and everything that you need to know when you're reading a book, and I actually have literally chuckled and laughed at how witty and humorous the -- some sides of his are. Like, for instance, he talks about Shakespearian quotes, and he just has all of these random, like, quotes, and I actually chuckled when I read one. I don't know what play this is from; if somebody could help me out with what play this is, by the way, drop a comment. Um, Exit -- let me see if I can get this -- Exit, pursued by a bear.  And I literally stopped and I started chuckling almost, um, because I just thought that that's kind of funny. I mean -Book number three, The Once and Future King by T. H. White. Quite, um -- quite hefty. I mean, it's six hundred pages of solid reading. Um, I'm actually enjoying this. I'm on page -- what am I on? I'm somewhere around page a hundred and seventy -- a hundred seventy or so. And, I enjoy it. I mean, I -- I don't like King Arthur. I don't like Arthurian fantasy. But, I like fantasy. Um, I have -- I don't -- let me just grab this. Um, I have multiple, like, Dragonlance, and I don't know how many people know Dragonlance. Dragonlance -- box sets -- this is one of the three that I have, and I like fantasy and this is kind of along the lines of that, and it's really good. So, I'm enjoying that. Um, yeah.Reason two, I wanted to talk about music. You know, music, like, the kind you listen to on your iPod, um, in the bus and the car on the train on a plane. Um, because I haven't really expressed how much I like music on TV . Now, I know some of you are going to be, like, totally W. T and his bands, but, um, I just want to say I just want to give you guys an idea of what music, like, I listen to, or enjoy listening to.And you guys know, um, with the State Radio poster on the wall -- walk past the office counter. poster on the wall and on the wall. I'm kind of a college conference I'm -- I'm sorry. Okay. College Rock. Kind of advocate, fan. Um, I like Dave Matthews' band a lot. Um, I'm not even going to get into how much I like Dave Matthews' band, actually. Um, I also like a band -- I'm going to snatch this. You've seen this before, trust me. I'm and this is the set list -- the original set list from, um -- um, April fifth -- April fifth ? April fifth two thousand and nine, the acoustic show? Yeah. All right. They handed it to me off the stage, along with the pics, which I keep right up on the top of my desk with the set list.Um, and also, like, this band -- not many people have heard of this band -- totally, um -- what's? Recommend. Sorry. Recommend this band, Gomez. Great band, um; how do I describe it? Blues -- India Rock -- Grunge. That's kind of the way to describe it. Um, I wanna see them -- I didn't get a chance to see them when they came to Terminal Five in New York, uh, a couple months ago. Um, I'm -- I just gotten in the -- well, I didn't just get in to them. Uh, I kinda been -- my dad interested in them. My dad -- the Dead Head -- My dad. My dad. If you've read about them on my blog, you know a little bit about my dad. Um, he introduced me to Gomez. I actually knew the words to some of the songs before I even knew the titles. It's the same thing with Dead songs; like, I know the words -- I knew -- I knew the words Samson and Delilah before I actually heard Samson and Delilah by the Dead. -- or, them playing it, anyway. And, um, I like Gomez a lot. Um, I've listened, probably, to the song Hangover -- Be my -- like, five times today. Um, so, check your Gomez. And check out ; check out State Radio; check out . Um, I didn't think I said. Um, yeah. Obviously, you know what Dave Matthews band does. I'm not gonna play any of Dave Matthews band, because of copyright. Ooh.And, drum roll, please. . Reason three, I wanted to throw the idea up in the air to regular viewers, all six of you. Um, I wanted to do a little action. Whatever. I'll finish this in five minutes. I wanted to make a live show. I wanted to do a TV cable live broadcast, and I wanted to go on Blog TV. I know I'm talking really fast, but just stick with me and you can probably understand what I'm saying. I want to go on Blog TV and I wanted to do a live show. I thought it would be a lot of fun, and I wanted to know if you guys would watch, if you guys would advertise for it, if you guys would invite friends to come to the chat room and talk about stuff with me. Um, I might even have a contest or two; I don't know. Um, comment. Comments, comments, comments. Um, because I really wanna -- I really want some feedback on this, and I really would like to do this idea, but I don't know how many people would watch it, or how many people would actually benefit from me doing this. So, um, try to comment, because I really appreciate it, and I really want to do this. So let me know if you like the idea, if you have any recommendations, any sort a thing; I'm flexible. But the broadcast would probably be on a Friday or Saturday night, because I have a life. Kind of. That's all for now. I'm also running out of tape and I literally have one minute of tape left because I just used something -- I found something out for somebody else. Um, so, that did it. This is that blogger kid signing off. Okay, thanks. Bye.Hi. It's XXXX, and I'm one years old. Year. One year.","High","High","High"

"VLOG371","No, this is not an illusion. This is me right here in your internet, coming to you on my channel, making a video for the first time since April.You know, my summer was busy, but I'm not even going to make excuses. I just didn't make videos for the summer, and that was basically that. But let me just give you, like, a brief little rundown of things that happened during my summer.Yes. I went to San Francisco for a week, that was fun. I visited my cousin who works for YouTube. I got to see YouTube Headquarters. They have great food by the way, so go work for YouTube. I had like shrimp scampi and other gourmet items. San Francisco, basically one of the coolest I've ever been to.And I got to see Lauren , who now goes to my university where I'm at currently; I'm not at home. And Lauren goes here now, so it's great to see her everyday. That's Viva La Lauren, by the way.Though I was planning to take a big road trip to Canada, that did not exactly go through. However, me and two of my friends did take a road trip through the southern United States. We did ten states in five days, and it was amazing. Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana. Yes. That was it. Saw some really cool cities. There's lot's of history and culture and just fun in the South. It's dirty and it's humid and it's vibrant.Also, as I'm sure some of you did, I discovered a lot of great music this summer. In no particular order, here's some of the songs I was listening to.There was a time, everybody was around and I was testing with you.I am so creeped out when it ate, you so cute out when it late, and I got that boom, boom, boom, the future boom, boom, boom. Let me get in that.I'm just a ransom prince coming back from my freak out .So write for me mama, like, a wagon wheel. Write me, mama, any way you feel. Hey. Mama, write me.I've never meant to run away. You know I never want to hurt you. Don't even know . Why does love always feel like, why does love feel, why does love feel, love feel.Girl I want to party with you, girl I want to party with you. Girl I just want to take six beers.Girl -- It's a brand new goal, slow it down put in the push upside down. .Let me exchange you, exchange you because I dance long. People that watch me move and shake it across the dance floor. People that watch me move and shake it across the dance floor.So yes, that's pretty much been my summer in trips and working and blah, blah, blah, I don't want to bore you too much with this. But music was one of the great things to happen this summer. Movies, not so much. It's been kind of a crap summer for movies; not gonna lie.But I would love to hear from you in the comments. I'm not used to doing this whole comment sidebar thing, but sidebar comments, comments now I want to hear what songs did you listen to this summer. Your summer playlist, if you will.I believe that's all for me right now. I hope to be making videos regularly. We'll see how that actually goes, but I'm making videos on XXXX every Thursday with XXXX. I am always tweeting, and I am usually daily boothing as well. Leave me comments there that say, XXXX make more videos, and then maybe I will.I missed you guys. If you have video ideas, I'd love those -- I would really love to do something substantial.Peace out.","High","High","High"
"VLOG372","Guess what? I got a hair cut. Yeah, it's amazing. Um, it was getting really hard to control so I had to cut it, but luckily it grows back, so I -- I think I'll have it -- it'll be back soon enough.Look, I bought a book today. Um, it's called Odd Hours by Dean Koonst and I -- l think it will be a good book. So far from what I can tell it's about some kid who goes to California and doesn't find what he wants. Like every other book, that there's a kid that goes somewhere and does find what he wants.I also bought new Post it notes because I'm starting to run out and it turns out that the ones that are in color are actually cheaper than the ones that are all yellow, which I was going to buy all yellow ones. My wall over here that I keep a lot of notes on is starting to full -- to be full so. And I bought some new ones. And look, I also realized yesterday I have a book called The War of the Worlds, but look at this it is the unabridged -- I don't know if you can see that -- unabridged version. That's what the little word says. It's unabridged, yeah. That means that it's, like, the first -- that's the way it was when it first came out. It's amazing. So yeah.I have bad news though. My computer had a little clasp on it and I had to send my computer in to get it fixed by Dell. So that's going to suck. Um, but when it get's back it will be awesome. So I have to send it off sometime within the next two weeks so I can get it back before I go to college.And um, that's about it, so see ya later.PS -- Um, Andrew I need to still get those books from you so if you could call me and we could somehow get the books before you leave on Friday for college, that would be awesome.So uh, bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG373","Hey, YouTubers, so I just experienced something I thought was pretty scary. I just got back from my classes and I just experienced some of the scariest walks to class and from class. It is icy outside. The streets are slick with ice and so are the sidewalks and I had a class, today, one class, today, one, one class at twelve thirty, so I left my apartment at about eleven fifty. I got over there at about twelve fifteen, that's how long it took me to get from here, my apartment, all the way to the campus and it was scary, because I was trying not to fall down the entire time. There was a couple of times I almost fell, but thankfully I lowered myself to the ground, so I didn't fall too badly. The reason why I don't want to fall again is because I already fell about two weeks ago, I guess now, and I skinned my knee and it hurt and I didn't want to repeat that again, especially with ice because that's really cold. So it was really scary because I was walking and I had slipped and I was sliding and it was really scary and you might think I am being overly dramatic about this, but I'm not. I'm from a place where it normally doesn't get all that icy and here it's really icy. They closed the campus at two o'clock and took a long time just to get back. Got back and I had a message on my phone, it's from work. They are closing the Public Library down at five o'clock due to the weather which is when I would normally go in to work. Thank goodness for that because I don't know how I would have made it to work. I was gonna have to call in and say I could not because there is no way I was going to go anywhere. So I'm guessing the city is closing down. A lot of things looked like they were closing down, everybody is being sent home, campus is shut down. So, yeah, it's pretty scary out there.Now why am I telling you this? Because I have nothing else to do. I am pretty much going to be locked up for the rest of the night, and as far as I know, right now, I don't know if I'm going to have classes tomorrow or not. I'm hoping not because it's supposed to be really bad tonight. I'm hoping that tomorrow they'll say no, don't come to class and then the library will still be closed and then I'll be another day stuck inside, here, but that gives me an opportunity to catch up with school work, which I need to do because I haven't done it yet. That's all I really had to say. Just freaking out about the ice and I'm going to go get me some lunch now and eat and then just, I'm here for the rest of the night. So, that's all YouTube.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG374","﻿Hey, lovely YouTubers. Long time no speak to you. How are you all? Hope you're good. As you may or may not have noticed, I put a video up yesterday. It was a video that was made for me a very long time ago by some lovely people -- really lovely people that I consider -- meeting those people was one of the best things that ever happened to me.And they made for me a birthday video to the tune of, um, you don't have to be rich to be my girl. You know, Prince. Kiss, that's the one I was thinking about, that one. And Prince is particularly fussy about um, copyright issues and stuff like that, so needless to say the video was uh, taken down within, like, a second of it being put up. Um, and for that YouTube sucks major arse. Really big, big bottoms.How have things been in the land of me? Well, my kid had -- had his operation, tendon -- tendon lengthening on his foot and leg -- four different operations in one go. He's in plasters still.Um, he started a new school, which has been a fucking nightmare. The transition to that -- he's fallen God knows how many times. He's hurt himself God how many times. Some kid came up to him in school the other day. He had, um, Sam's got, um, you know one of those big shoes they give you to put one when you're wearing a cast. He's got one of them on. Some kid walked past him and said, hey, nice shoe, spacker, where can I get one? Of course, Sam told me about this and I saw the kid the next day. And, uh, I gave him a nice evil look, you can imagine. And he looked at the floor and went all red and walked away really quickly. Next time I see him I'm going to drop kick that motherfucker.Um, quite the t shirt -- Wonder Woman. I actually bought it after going to the gym. I started the gym again, um, which I am completely loving -- three nights a week. Um, with a couple of friends and it's awesome fun. Nice to get a good workout.It's Saturday which means my lovely, lovely sister is coming to see me today. And my brother won't be because he has a job now -- his first job.I'm just looking out the window, sorry. This is why I can't -- I just don't make YouTube videos anymore. I can't, like, keep my attention. The painters have been outside painting the house and it looks like they've just crushed several of my plants, which was really considerate of them. Not my day.Um, I don't know what to say. Bye.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG375","﻿Hello, hello, YouTube. Long time no see, huh? Um, so I just wanted to say hello to you guys and give a -- kind of like a little update and everything. I just want to say I have not forgotten about all of you. Just kind of took a break -- a break, since August, I guess. I think that is the last time I made an update weight loss video. So I just wanted to say, I have not forgotten about you, I still check this YouTube channel pretty often, and I'm still following a lot of you guys on your weight loss journeys and yeah. I mean, I kind of have just been a way for a while, school kind of consumes my life when I get started with it. I really hoped to continue make videos throughout the school year but that just wasn't a possibility. I was just so, so wrapped up in school this year, but I'm finally done. So that is super exciting.Um, so the end of April, which is about the same time that I started last year with the whole weight loss thing. So hopefully like you know a year later you can kind of get back on the bandwagon and everything else. Um, that's not to say that I've fell off the bandwagon exactly. You know, last year around this time you know I weighed about probably close to two hundred pounds or something like that, and I started on a weight loss program, and I lost close to about fifty pounds, I would say. And, I've kept basically all of that off. Right now I'm weighing approximately, like, one hundred sixty one pounds. So that's basically what I weighed in August. I think that I was around one -- let's see, what did I weigh? Um, I dunno. It was something like that. It's on my main channel page. But I've basically stayed the same. I haven't gained. I haven't really lost. I mean, I guess you can look at that as a little, small victory, woohoo. But yeah! I don't really have much today. Just to say I haven't really gained, I haven't really lost. Yeah. So I've been doing good.I've not really been watching what I've been eating. , I do occasionally go and walk at a park near my house. So, but that's not really a whole lot of exercise. I think a lot of you, you know I kind of feel guilty because I feel like some of you, that if you don't watch what you eat every second of the day, or if you don't get in your thirty minutes of exercise, you know you'll gain a pound within like a day. And I've just been very blessed with being able to maintain my weight even when I'm not really trying. And um, I just have to make sure that I don't abuse that and turn that into, oh I can eat whatever I want because I mean, obviously I can't. You know, I can't go out and pig out and eat ice cream and pizza and have a little birthday party diet, what me and my friends like to call it, eating like it's your birthday every week. But, um, yeah I can't do that. You know I still have to try and get a balanced healthy diet with salad, lean meat, um, you know, I don't drink any regular soda. If I am gonna drink soda, I drink diet. I try to drink water or I get those Crystal Lite packets, and I, you know, it looks gross, like pee or something, but it's just the lemonade flavor, Crystal Lite.And you know, it's all about moderation, if you want to have you know the bowl of ice cream, eat the bowl of ice cream, but the next day maybe have a bowl of fruit for dessert? I mean, I dunno, I don't always follow that advice. I'm a very good advice giver, I just don't normally follow it, but that's kind of just the things you have to do to try and maintain your weight. You can't just go nuts and it's all about self control. So it's kind of like my little tip of the day.Hopefully, I can start making videos again because I am done with school for the year. Um, I'm about to go out of town for the next two weeks. My boyfriend is graduating so I'm about to go and visit him and watch his graduation. That's next week and then two weeks after that, or a week after that or something I'm going on a road trip with one of my good friends. So that will be fun. But after that hopefully I can kind of start making videos more regularly again.Um, see, I dunno, there not like a whole lot to say in terms of progress. Like again, I haven't really gained or lost, I keep saying that. I'm sure your like, I know I get it now, okay, gee! Um, but yeah! So just know that I haven't forgotten about you guys and for all the new subscribers that I've gotten, thank you so much. I'm sure your like watch my videos and like okay, this girl is cool, you know I can watch her, and then I kind of did nothing or anything, so your probably like, what the heck? Come on! So um, but no, kind of my, hopefully my little will come back, hopefully. Um, yeah. So, I guess be looking out for some new videos. I kind of have a few things planned so, yeah. I guess I will talk to you guys later. Bye!","Low","Low","High"

"VLOG378","﻿Do you remember your first computer? So I was writing this paper for my consumerism class on that kind of topic and it got me thinking. Our parents tell us stories about remembering getting their first television or switching from black and white to color, and our grandparents still reminisce about the radio. But we are the generation who when we have our own kids, are gonna be saying things like, my first computer only had five hundred twelve megabytes of RAM, and I had to walk two miles in the snow uphill both ways just to get to Frye's , to get my floppy disc.I was eight when my family got our first computer. I was busy playing outside when my dad was hooking it up. I remember him sitting me down and saying, XXXX, this is a very big day that you're going to remember for the rest of your life. I also remember looking at him at this point, saying cool, then asking if I could go back outside so I could play on my swing set, which was, at the time, incredibly superior in fun levels to this boring computer my parents were trying to get me to play with.About a year later, I had my first experience with the Internet. I was in elementary school, and my classroom had one computer that they had at the back of the room. And there's this one day that they let every single person in my class have fifteen minutes to go surf the web. During my turn, I just sat down and stared at the screen for a minute before turning to the person who's supervising us and saying, so what do I do? She told me to check out a website -- to search for something that I like. I remember that I typed in Hanson, went to some weird Hanson fan site, looked around for five minutes and got bored, and then gave up the rest of my turn to someone else.A lot's changed since then. So basically, I was wondering what your first experiences were with the computer or with the Internet. Were you old enough to remember it? Were you super excited about it or did you just not care, like me? I mean, granted, this was a very long time ago. Also, if you want to see the latest adventures in the apartment rent series, then you can check out the link to the Mosbeys in video in the sidebar thing. Seriously, our family's first computer, in order for me to play my Baby Sitters Club game, my dad had to actually uninstall my brother's Tonka truck game because we only had enough hard drive space to have one game installed at a time. Those were the days. Okay that's all for now. See ya. Also if you want to see what's -- ha ha. I had to uninstall the apartment rent story. Argh.","High","High","High"

It's in a white bag, and it's got a big Apple logo on it and it's making me dribble. That means something my parents have just given me is from Apple. So I opened it gently, and I got Snow Leopard. OMG, and it's got iLife o nine and iWork o nine. Incredibly I'm dribbling, mouth watering and ecstatic. That means, I'm -- this, my computer I'm using now has hardly anything compared to Snow Leopard.

And that computer is older. Just remember that.Alright. Enough of that. Back to something serious. As you can see, I'm wearing a completely ridiculous hat, that's because my grandmother bought it for me and it's actually really, really warm. Figured.News, there's a party on tonight and I don't know if I should go. I've been trying to call everyone and nobody that I know is going.

"VLOG385","Hey Nerd piteria . Right now you're probably wondering why is this girl dressed up like Harry Potter? Well, that's for a really good reason. The charity I'm supporting today in my Project for Awesome Video has really changed my life. And so, it's Harry Potter. So, let's get to it.In the summer of two thousand and eight, I was diagnosed with a mild form of epilepsy, which meant my arms would shake when I would wake up in the morning sometimes, and they would consider this a seizure. Then in January of two thousand and nine, I had my first grand seizure in which my whole body seized up and I ended up hitting my head before blacking out. Um, this is an experience that changed my life and really freaked me out.﻿The charity that I'm supporting this year is the Epilepsy Foundation. Um, for a couple of reasons. First they use all their money for a lot of research; and ways to prevent and treat epilepsy and make life for those who are epileptic better. And also because, um, after I had my grand mall seizure I was able to go on there and talk to people who have, um, had grand mall seizures before. And talk about them and relate to them, because there's nobody, um, for me to talk to in real life about what I was going through. It's really a great organization and one that's really close to my heart and it would mean a lot to me if could help it out this year, um, so yeah. DFTB","High","High","High"

"VLOG387","﻿Darwin influenced Freud a lot. Which is true, he did. Um, he was a big influence on Freud's work. Um, and he, Darwin, also believed, you know, the survival of the fittest, and, you know, um, the primal urge of, you know, back -- way back in caveman, kinda sticks with us. And, um, my professor was basically saying that sexual attraction is evolutionary as well, and that, you know, men are attracted to really skinny girls, with a certain hip to waist ratio, um, because, you know, that's their primal instinct, their primal urge. They wanna be with those girls because they're gonna be the healthiest and they're gonna last the longest and blah, blah, blah, for mating ritual things. And that, like, girls are attracted to really muscular guys, because, um, they'll take care of them and survive the longest.Um, first of all, that -- my battery is dying, shit, hold on -- okay. Don't mind the dirty laundry behind me. That, you know, it's primal instinct because guys who are muscular are going to take care of them more and survive the best and be able to fight off those saber tooth tigers et cetera.Well, , and you know, it's a good theory, um, however I find a lot of flaws in it. Um, first off, the flaws I find are that a, if a guy was going to be attracted to the girl who was going to last the longest, like live the longest, and be able to bear him children, I don't think he would be attracted to the really skinny girls. I mean, I -- I have nothing against really skinny girls, um, -- I have friends who are really skinny -- but I think that, you know, as far as bearing children, they -- wouldn't they want someone with a little bit more meat and hip and being able to, you know, bear that child? And also, as far as live the longest, back then, like way, way, way, way back in history, fatter -- I mean, they didn't have all the signs of cardio problems and stuff -- so fatter seemed healthier because you weren't starving. You weren't sickly. You weren't going to, you know, just die from starvation, or, you know, be able to be freezing in the winter. You'd have more meat on you to keep you warm.So I find a flaw in that, because I don't think that that would be, you know, the case. And also, I think it's kind of sexist, in a way, because who says that girls have to be attracted to the muscular guys, to take care of them. Um, I mean, I was perfectly fine without a guy. I don't need a guy to take care of me. Um, I chose the guy I love because I love him, and we're good companions, and we take care of each other. So I don't need some muscular guy to ward off saber toothed tigers, no. Give me Arabia, and I'll fence off the saber toothed tiger. I fence, well, I used to, but I want to continue.So, I mean, seriously -- I just think that it's ridiculous, personally. And I think attraction, as far as mass attraction, like what we're told to think is attractive, is fed to us by the media. By TV shows, music, posters, um, yeah, it's just fed to us. And we're told what is socially acceptable from early on. Even, like, little kids, when you tell them bed time stories, the beautiful princess was thin, tall, long blond hair, golden hair, and blue eyes. Be passionate and hyped up about this, because, like, seriously, it is just fed to us through society, not just the media, but society in general and our culture. In the United States, and the world today, because of mass communications and, just everything, story books, Disney movies, you know, everything tells us to like a certain type of person.True beauty and true love and attraction is just in the eye of the beholder. I've never liked muscular men. I've always thought muscles were kinda gross. I mean, not like normal muscles, but I mean like, the big muscles, six packs, you know, like the ripped guys. I always thought that just looked unnatural and just gross. There are also a lot of guys who are attracted to BBW's and are kind of in the closet about it. And also, back to the primal instinct thing, if it was solely attraction on primal urge of mating rituals, then why are there so many people who are homosexual? That is just, like, love and attraction that is not, you know, a primal urge, um, so yeah, it's not just a primal mating ritual. Okay.So I believe in soulmates, and I believe in reincarnation, and I believe we have many lives. So I believe that people that we are attracted to, it's because we are attracted to their soul. Because, either we knew them in another life, or we knew them in heaven, or we wanted to know them. So I think -- it's just a beautiful and romantic thing that we're connected to certain people, um, and it's more in depth. Um, I also think that's why we're connected to certain animals more, like certain pets, because maybe we knew them in another life, maybe they were human before. Um, I just -- I don't know. I have a very Pollyanna view on the world so, -- I've been told -- I don't know, maybe you shouldn't listen to me, but I'm a very hopeless romantic, philosophical, everything is fantasy and beauty, and whatever. But that's just how I am, and it's just what I believe, um, I'm not really scientific, but it's just a feeling that's inside me, you know, but, um, yeah.And another thing I noticed is, erm, a lot of people are attracted to people of the same body type. I know at least it's from -- it's that way for me. I've dated a couple of really skinny guys, and I never liked dating guys who are skinnier or smaller than me. That always made me feel so huge and it just -- it made me feel very uncomfortable, and it was just my own self esteem issue. So when looking for a guy, I would look for a guy who was the same, a little smaller, or bigger than me, but not really skinny, because I just -- I would feel really like a giant if I was around a really skinny guy, and no girl wants to feel like that. But again, that's also a societal thing. Girls can't be bigger than their guys, another society pushed thing. So, yeah, I think attraction -- sexual attraction is, you know, on a whole, in the eye of the beholder, and everybody finds someone else attractive. And also, it's also society, what they push you to find attractive, and what you grow up learning is attractive.But one of my favorite quotes is, I don't love you because I think you're attractive, I think you're attractive because I love you. And, it's so true. My husband will always be attractive to me, because I love him, and I'm sure it's on the other end. At least, he's told me that. So I'll leave you with that quote. Thanks. Bye. Happy Monday.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG388","﻿Not turned on. Not turned on.Hi guys, it's been a while since I made a video and I want to make a video with a general update and to . I went to last week. It was awesome. Uh, it was an epic concert. They really put on the show. It was really amazing.On December fifth we had a celebration uh, Sin -- Sinta Claus it's called. Similar to San -- Santa Claus but we also do uh, do presents under the christmas tree, but we don't uh, the children here don't believe in Santa Claus, they believe in Sinta Claus.I got some cool presents. I will show you in the DVD update I'm gonna do. Um, it was awesome. So I didn't come to do no more videos so, because -- and in the situation, and that is, um, I told you I got a job. I love my job. And, yeah.If people tell you a story why they lose their job and what's the story, the -- it's not their fault. You're always thinking, yeah. But what is the story of the other -- of the other side from the people who fired them? What's the real reason? Someone -- someone who is fired always tells they're not at fault. They're, uh, or they don't tell the whole story, yeah? But I am certainly one of the guys who, yeah. Definitely gonna tell the story straight. How -- how -- how it went.Um. Media, uh, minimarts. I work at Stern . Uh, I explained that in the other video, and they're the same as the MediaMarket and the MediaMarket is more known as they're all around the world, so some people may know -- may know it, some people not.This is like -- it's like a big -- a big entertainment store and they sell TVs, CDs, DVDs, video games, uh, washing machines, you call it. And Saturn is the same as that, basically the same company only they're smaller.And they hired me two months ago uh, for uh, uh, for -- to do sales only on the CD/DVD video games and most times when you try to sell something it's on the section from the DVD game -- uh, the video games. Wednesday, they invited me to have a talk because uh, my period -- yeah, my period -- this sounds very wrong -- uh, my -- my trial period at their store almost expended and I went -- I went uh, yeah, to be exactly yesterday but I went to Brussels uh, this weekend um, for the Christmas .But so they invited me for a talk and they said uh, yeah, after this period uh, we have to do a lot of -- yeah. Uh, they have to send back a lot of CDs, DVDs. They have to get -- things out of the shop, uh, because of the store and send them back to the uh, to the distribution company or someone else. All of this administration work, and they -- they said I wouldn't -- uh, yeah, um -- I wouldn't yeah do that, or we'll not -- could not handle that or something like that.At the time yeah, I should have been sharper and said, why you think that, why do you think I can't handle that? But I was so overwhelmed by more like, what the hell's happening? Um, and that was just a bullshit reason because um, they could check how much -- I was -- I sold a lot. I was every day, almost every day, I was a top uh, top salesman from all the stuff in the store. I was number three or number two, once num -- number one. Because I did -- I -- I -- I did -- I sold very well. I did -- I was a very good salesman on the floor. So it wasn't a reason, yeah, to get me fired but then, uh, yeah, I was really -- someone who first -- or last of all think what the hell's happening, and afterwards I really can get pissed. I'd use a line the one like this, I'm really wishing the worst of people who are responsible for getting me -- get -- getting me fired.I think why -- why would you do something -- why let someone quit his uh, part time job and then in the same -- at the station -- uh, oh fu -- how do you say that -- that was a period -- trial period over, it's moved over and you get a contract for half a year. That's really pissed me off. I really feel like slapping or punching someone in the face. I don't -- I don't -- I -- I do now that it doesn't help but it feels good to -- to make them -- yeah, feel what I feel.Okay this sounded like -- like -- a little bit sorry, it's just uh, rage and it's more talk than yeah, I'd actually -- something, do really something but I'm not going to, I just feel better. It was a temporary job.How I hope I've hooked this contract for six months and find something else that fits my education uh, because I don't do -- I didn't -- yeah, I did -- I started with a low education in middle school and worked to, uh, yeah, do college for -- study for -- for construction with that there's a middle NBO called external for that kind of qualification and then do a high -- uh, higher education. That's just a step below university, it's called HBO by the way, that's uh, very funny, but um, when you finish you don't -- that you find a job that fits your study and, yeah, pays more than what I do now. This job what I did -- pay money and I had something to do -- this job didn't pay much but I learned how to sell something, how to communicate with people. I can barely -- I was really friendly to customers, I really could help them, get on their level and so it did help them with the good sales. This they disrespect me so much there. Um.Also the reason I think -- I realize now, first that it was -- it made any sense. They had training to sell, to train you -- to train your sale -- to train you into make better sales and they told me first uh, day they forgot to plan me uh, in for the courses, for the training and now it makes sense because if you hire someone who you uh, who you -- who you kick away after a struggle why put him on courses? It's only a waste of money.So that's probably the reason why I -- they forgot to -- to -- to put me on the training. So yeah, so I know help, you have to be the better one and eh. This -- this is not my work but I -- I didn't do this but this is my brother's work. I ripped out the buttons and that is a small work shirt and my brother made it -- knots in it and it's very -- really tight and I have to deliver them back.When you've worked there up to two months you get twenty percent off the price, uh, so I asked, I wanted to get screened there and it wasn't -- they didn't -- the delivery have to come in and then first going to get but that with twenty percent off the price, and then I come to deliver the keys back. That's all, yeah. I had the paper, they had to sign the paper and you contract a day when you don't give them back or something like that you have to pay fifty Euro or so, but I am not going to. She saw I had first gone to buy the screen and then I going to deliver these forms back.it's really childish, but I had to put on my rates on something and I -- my rent. So yeah, I don't got a job now, I don't want to go back to my job where I worked and do that full time, I thought I hate it when it's part time, but this is the only place where I got certainty to go back to for now and but I don't want to. It's five days in a week and it with -- I really hate it and I don't want to go there.So. Okay. Had a -- um, also I want to say on twenty six November -- on November of twenty six, um, I went, um, I was a year on YouTube with this channel.

Uh, it was really cool, a very, very cool community and I am very happy here. I hope I reach the four hundred subscribers before I, uh -- I hit the full year, so its nice number, but yeah, sounds about the subscribers, but -- but it will be fun though.Um, so yeah, I really -- really um, I want to thank -","Low","High","Low"

I met her friends, and they are really cool; and halfway through, we stood up because we were right in the front and they didn't want to be; they wanted to go to the back, so they went to the back, so me and my other friend were like stuck. We were like, this high in a mosh about people who are like, this high. We were just like looking up at them, like, hi! It wasn't that violent, like, people didn't like, bash you or anything because you just like, -- if people tried pushing, you would just swipe them and push them away. Fuck you, .So it was all good. There were these really scary lasses who liked screaming out, yes, because they wanted to get in front of us, so we moved away because we didn't want to get bashed , so we walked away, and I need to get my photos developed. I will get them developed tomorrow and put them up. Um, I haven't made a video in ages, and I'm sorry, . Kids opened up , and they were really cool, and I got a picture of the really hot guitarist. Um, and I've got a really busy weekend.Tomorrow I'm seeing XXXX again, and then in the night I'm going to my friend's party, and then on Sunday I have Animal Farm rehearsals, and then I just have to do all my homework in the night, and that's going to be exciting.I drew some things in class this time, and I really wanted to show you, but I couldn't find it. I drew this picture that I digitalized. I stayed up -- that was the first time I had stayed up on a school night until, uh, all night, um, just on my laptop just speaking to people who wouldn't let me go to sleep, so I went there, and then I did a period monster during Hebrew and geography.Um, I'm going to camp in a couple of weeks.

"VLOG39","Hello everybody on my YouTube list. Today we have something very special. Im doing SS report 'cause I had no other name. The SS report today is very special. It's Thanksgiving. Today is the day we all give thanks to the things that matter most. And right the things that matter most are my fans. I'd just like to give a shout out to all the wonderful people. Now there's so many people that I can't name you all on one video, it would take about maybe two or three because you guys are just awesome. I want you guys to know that I appreciate everything you've brought me through. Now if you can hear, there's Christmas music playing in the background. There's a reason for that. That's part two of this video. I want you guys to know that you guys have brought me so far and I give thanks for that. Also I give thanks for all the people in the US of A and all the people across seas and everyone who's a part of this community and is so helpful and supportive to YouTube members. I give thanks to you. I also give thanks to family. If you have a family, I have a family, give thanks to them. I give thanks to family. So that's fans, people on the globe and family. Another thing I would have to give thanks for is all those haters because when I get haters, I've noticed that it rises my population. I don't say I want to keep having haters but thank you so I have to show you some love. I would also like to thank the Internet for providing Twitter. Twitter's amazing. I'd also like to thank -- I'd like to thank the people at Blizzard. They've finally found a way to screw up World of Warcraft even worse. Thank you. Not only would I like to thank Blizzard and everybody else I just mentioned, I would also like to thank the people behind Microsoft. Updating to Windows Seven, it's a pretty good idea. Then again, everybody is practically switching to a Mac. I'm on PC and I love it. Now, why the Christmas music is playing and was playing in the background. Let's talk about something. People, obviously it's Christmas time -- well it will be Christmas time come next week. Tuesday of next week will be December first and twenty five days, we'll be counting. Twenty five miserable days because on that twenty fifth day, it's all happiness. Well I guess some people do Christmas Eve. So maybe it's twenty three days actually so I should have said twenty four days at the beginning. Now I know that all my fans out there are excited for Christmas and if you don't celebrate Christmas for any reason or if you're not a Christmas person, happy holidays still and I want you to enjoy this month that we don't get any winter in or snow, so --. But it will be very cool. It's ironic, there's all this cold but no snow. Now, not to mention that, I want everybody to do their best. I want everybody to have a safe, um, time. Have a fun time. And black Friday's this Friday, you can get a lot of savings. Save a lot. I think that's when everybody's going to do their Christmas shopping. Then again, black Friday's dangerous 'cause you know people get injured and trampled and stuff like that. It's happened before people. So be careful if you plan on going out for black Friday and, uh, you know, make -- just make sure that you guys just have fun. Keep coming back. This has been the SS Report, episode one, giving thanks and happy holidays. Those of you who would like to check this out more, my new email which you can contact me on, will be in the description.

"VLOG390","﻿Hey, super short video, um, so last night, um, my brother kidnapped me, and we went to, um, the town I used to live in where he lives now, and um, we kind of sort of partied but it was kind of lame, 'cause there was drama, and there was a lot of drama and, like, a couple of people got way, way, freaking drunk, and I ended up being the babysitter with uh, my friend, Brani, who doesn't drink, and we ended up freaking taking care of this fucking psychotic girl who just really seriously is a crazy lightweight. Like, I've taken hydromorphone earlier in the day, that's, um, Dilaudid, it's, um, an opiate for migraines. Well, it's not specifically for migraines; my doctor gave it to me for migraines and I, um, I took two earlier in the day and um, I don't know, it was, um, I don't know a total of like four or five milligrams of hydromorphone and that's pretty serious stuff and uh, granted, uh, I had like in six hours -- fourteen, to wear down, but still -Um, yeah, so I was drinking, and uh, I had quite a bit, for someone who's on opiates and she was wasted, like, a really, really long time, before I was. And I was like, that's ridiculous; you are a crazy lightweight. And that's pathetic and you know, you're annoying, and you're hitting on me and I don't like girls. And like, oh, it was just so, so horrible. And I'm so, like you know, I just want to hang out with my brother before he goes to Iraq and you are totally just ruining the night. So I'm going to go back over there before he leaves next week on Thursday. So what was I saying; I'm gonna go back there and chill, without alcohol, because I just want to have a nice, you know, few hours hanging out with my baby brother because he's leaving for Iraq and I won't be seeing him for like a year or so. So um, yeah, hopefully she won't be there and she's off puncturing her face. Um, but yeah, that's what went down yesterday and I'm about out of time.

"VLOG391","﻿Socializing is somewhat of a difficult task for me. You may be asking yourself, what is so difficult about socializing? Would it be the awkward silence in between series of questions? Nope. Or maybe it's the fact that you state one of your interests as collecting dictionaries? What? No. Oh, look, an Italian dictionary, um bi net oo, toilet. Or perhaps it's awkward that you tell people you write blog skits for YouTube? Why did I write that in there? Socializing is awkward simply because I have to state my name. Yup, that's it.

And so I'm thinking and I'm trying to figure what day it is and I'm, like, wait, Thursday, no. Tuesday, wait no. Today is Thursday, no it's not and then I realized it is Tuesday, so hi. Um, I'm back, I'm sorry about last week. I was super sick, um, ah, the fever was, like, around one hundred and I've had it for, like, not last Friday but the Friday before through like Monday. So I missed, like, three days of school which means I have a bagillion and one things -- homework to make up. But I'm caught up, everything is all better and I don't have nearly as much, like, sinus issues and all that, so that's always fun to get rid of. And actually I can smell things and I can taste things when I eat them so I'm very glad to have all my senses back.Um, let's see here. Um, I'm finally here on Tuesday and I like it. It feels kind of nice except I'm going to have to get used to it because obviously I'm bad at this because I thought all ready, so sorry for it being late.Um, thank you for all the diagnosis -- es -- that diagnosis es -- how do you say that? Um, every guess and opinion on my haunted toilet. Yeah, it's crazy. Um, Glee, oh my goodness, the season -- I don't want to say the season finale, but it kind of was; kind of wasn't.They're saying it's going to be the same thing when it comes back. Oh my God, but now it was on and it was so good except I want Ben and Rachel be together, but you know what you gotta take the time. He just -- he just found out, so we're going to give him some time. I'm super duper excited. I loved it. I loved it. Who loved the Will and Anna little bit at the end?And I cannot stop obsessing over the number that they did sectional and it was, like, the only thing that I really wish would have happened was um, for, like, I would have liked to see them announce the winner at sectionals 'cause I was, like, that's kinda a lame way to introduce and you're, like, ta dah. Well, yeah, but, I loved it.I love the show so much I'm just, like, gah and I found out today that uh, Glee has been nominated for four Golden Globes awards. Um, it's, like, for the best comedy or musical tel -- television series or whatever. Excuse me. And Mathew Morrison, Lea Michelle, and Jane Lynch have been nominated um, individually. So I'm, like, Golden Globe after only, like, half a season, that's insane. I'm so happy. And um, the first season or first half season, whatever, comes out on DVD at the end of the month, December twenty ninth, so make sure you all get that. I don't know if I talked about the second soundtrack, but I got that too. It's really awesomAnd, oh, this week is midterms week because I don't have school next week. I think you all know what midterms are. So yeah, um, let's see here. Wednesday -- again sorry for yawning -- Wednesday, which is tomorrow, I have chemistry and Spanish midterms and then Thursday I have history and English and then to round it off, I have humanities and algebra two and I've always hated tests. This is, like, this -- these three days and the three days before you have to school are, like, the most dreaded days of the year, but you have to be there. So I don't know. I hate it, but what are you going to do?Um, Christmas is coming up. I cannot believe how fast everything has gone by and, like, how, just, like, I think about it sometimes and I'm, like, it cannot all ready be December you know? It seems, like, just yesterday I was turning sixteen in January during the middle of an ice storm and um, by the way, that's all I want for my birthday this year. You know, to not have an ice storm going on.Um, so, yeah, it's just crazy. I mean, so many things have gone on and it's, like, I was telling people earlier. Like, my friends and I, we used to say, you know, we used to talk about imagine what it would be like when we we're these big high school kids, you know? When we're big kids and we could drive and when we're teenagers and it's, like, now we are. We're living all the stuff that, you know, we had talked about since we were little.And my brother and I -- you know I used to always think, I wonder what it is going to be like when we are big? I wonder what it's going to be like, you know, and I'm, like, I was just looking around the other day and I was, like, oh my God we are big. He's thirteen. I'm sixteen. He's going to be a freshman next year and I'm going to be a senior in high school. I mean, it's just crazy. I'm starting to get all um, nostalgic on you. I'm just kind of, -- I mean just take a minute right now or when the video goes off or whatever and just take a minute and just pause and think about it. And just think about like how much time has passed and just be, like, I cannot even that I'm all ready here. I mean, flows, it seems and when you think about it in general, time passes really fast. So, I don't know. I'm just kind of, like, braah, you know?Merry Christmas early, um, I will see you guys next week. Bye. Oh, one more thing um, I will go ahead and ah, closed off with some new pictures of the Glee cast and also some clips from the season -- er, not season but the Volume Two soundtrack, huh, I really, really, really need to get going.

"VLOG394","I'm going to ask a question, don't expect an answer because nobody really ever answers any of my questions in these stupid things anyways. Ah, I read the story today about the -- ah, ah, four or five Guantanamo, um, uh, detainees that have openly, um, admitted to planning and setting into motion the, um, um, September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center. And in the statement that they released, it essentially -- from the way it's told they bra -- were bragging about the fact that they -- that it was so successful. Um, they were very proud of how successful it was and how it was a gift from them to God.Um, the confusion I get is that this is no surprise to me. I mean, the fact that it's a surprise to anyone is -- is more of a surprise to me than these particular detainees saying that. I mean, especially considering they honestly believe their religion and their God is telling them, or maybe not so much literally telling them, but dictates that they are supposed to do these things. That their religion dictates that they're supposed to, um, punish the infidels, which they consider non Muslims to be. Um, they're extremists. That's kind of the thing. You know, extremists do extreme things based on their religious beliefs. It's not a big surprise, but it seems like it's being portrayed as a horrible, awful, ruthless, evil thing that these people are bragging about it. The people, um, extremists of every religion do some freaky ass shit. Christians did it. Muslims do it. I mean, don't know enough about Jews to know if they did -- do it. Um, Buddhists follow Buddha. I mean, starts off being scrawny and skinny, keeping themselves from eating and then turns into, ah, you need to eat, eat, eat, eat and enjoy everything about life, fat Buddha, bald Buddha. Every extremist in every religion does some weird shit. Um, I'm not excusing. Um, I -- I personally do not believe that it is right to uh -- to cause harm or to hurt anyone who has, at best, a vague connection to the government or military which you think you're having a war with and this is where my confusion comes in.Um, I don't understand how I can understand the point of view of the terrorists, don't agree with of the -- even the extreme groups such as the Taliban and some of the insurgent groups and why. I can understand some of their motivation, some of the reasoning behind it and I'm sure if I, you know, went and just researched it more, probably interviewed people or whatnot like that, that are involved in these particular situations, I would understand their motivation a lot more. It doesn't mean I would agree with their -- their actions, um, it just means I would understand why. It's sort of like ah, you have a weird brother or sister, for some strange reason whenever they get into a car, ah, they start picking their nose. Um, I'm pretty sure you could probably find why they do that. Ah, ah, it's the same thing. You can find out the reason for everything. You might not agree with the action, but you can understand and find out why did this happen or why did they do this. But nobody it seems in the United States is attempting in any way, shape or form, to do that. I mean, we also see how big a failing that is. One of the biggest problems that we've seen in the Middle East throughout history is the lack of trying to find out, the lack of concern of understanding why or the motivations of Middle Eastern people. Great Britain, when it had, ah, much of the Middle East as it's colonies, um, as -- as under its protection, its control as colonies, they failed because they didn't understand or even bother to understand. Ah, the Russians, ah, huge war in, I think, it's either Iran or Afghanistan, one of those two countries they failed because they didn't bother to try to understand and, um, sadly enough, and a lot of people will get pissed about this, the United States was failing in Iraq for the same reason. We refused to or just didn't have the ability to understand or even try to figure it out, ah, um, the whys and the -- the um, the motivations and actually we currently are being so successful, not because of military might, but from all reports, it's back room deals. Um, discovering motivation and giving them other motivation, ah, making connections that we didn't make before non military things and yes, there are some black offs that go on too, but it's -- it's more based on intelligence and -- and understanding and discovering the answers. The motivation to things then it was military might. Military might got us nowhere. Military might got Great Britain nowhere. Military might got Russia nowhere. I mean, it has gotten no one when it come to the Middle East anywhere, but for some strange reason, in the United States, all we can think of or whenever it comes to terrorists or anybody associated with terrorism or anybody associated with, um, September eleventh and those attacks and what went on like that, um, what we should do is we should do anything that we can to get them to confess to having something to do with any of those certain things, just to keep us safe and not lock them in the legal rights that we have. Um, that we should in any shape or form try to understand any of this to maybe find a way of not -- of preventing something like this from happening again. Instead, it's they're evil, they're awful, you know, these are disgusting, horrible, horrible, evil, people that need to be just blown off the face of the planet. Um, it's not going to work and I just don't understand why -- why so many people refuse to even attempt to understand. I mean, it's like if you try to understand a person's motivation that's done something so horrible as killed three thousand people, it's like you're siding with them. It's like you're trying to excuse it. Ah, I mean that's the way people treat me whenever I ask them, you know, they're not evil they're just stupid, misguided, wrong, you know. It's the act that they did, from our point of view is evil, but they're not evil, they're doing what they think is right, but nobody will -- everyone is convinced that I have spoken to or asked about this, that I'm wrong. I mean, that in saying those things I'm saying what they did was excusable and I personally don't think that killing anyone is excusable. But in any case, it comes down to my question, um, which like I said nobody ever really watches these damn things and if they do, they don't actually answer my questions.Um, my question is this. The five or four Guantanamo Bay detainees that have taken, um -- taken responsibility for the, ah, ah, September eleventh attacks of the World Trade Centers and bragged about it and said it was a gift, ah, ah, to God, um. They did this believing that their religion, their God is -- wants them to do it, that this is what they are, um, supposed to do. This is what they are compelled to do based on their religion and I'm not saying that they're right, and their analysis of their religion. I mean, and there will be a lot of conceptions of any one religion, but that's what they believe. They believe that they are compelled to -- they are required to, by their God, by their religion, to perform these acts whether we find them horrible or not. I mean, they feel they have to do them, that this is part of their belief system. Um, so back to my question. The thing is whatever religion you happen to be, if, theoretically, your God, whoever you happen to worship showed up, right in front of you, just showed up and told you, um, or rather asked you to go and, uh, strap a bunch of C four to your waist and blow up everybody who's visiting the Lincoln Memorial Monument. And, um, and in asking why, your God told you because there are people there that are evil and they need to be destroyed, so I need you to go and destroy these people and if you don't do this then these evil people will continue to do some terrible, horrible things that will cause the death of children and women and innocent people, innocent people that you care about, would you go and do it? And then, if you did that, would you be evil for doing it? Because, I hate to say this, but a lot of these extremists, Muslim extremists that are performing these terroristic acts believe their religion and God is compelling them to do this; is asking them or demanding that they do these things. These acts that your God asked you or demanded or whatever your religious beliefs happen to be, for you to do, how would that make you any different than the terrorist. I mean, now we're saying, literally your God is asking or demanding that you do this, and that if you don't these evil people are going to cause harm to people that you care about. How, if you did it, would it be different than them doing it, when them","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG395","﻿Hey, everyone. I haven't made a blog in a while so I just thought I would update you all on a few things. What was the last thing we talked about? It's been a couple weeks -- it's been a few weeks since I made a blog. But, um. Here's what's going on at my job. As many of you know, I got taken off of my route job and I got put into the shop. I'm kinda back out on the route now but I'm training a new guy. And here's why. I trained a guy before. He was out on the route. He was doing a good job. He started slacking off. He started getting an attitude. He smarted off to the boss. He started looking kinda sloppy, not shaving, not tucking his shirt in, not wearing a belt. Told the boss that they didn't pay him enough for him to shave and tuck his shirt in, which is kinda bullshit. And after that he just -- it just seemed like he stopped caring then he went off on me in front of the boss. They fired his ass. So now I'm training a new guy. Also, this guy that they fired, he told the boss that I threatened to kill him which is bullshit, because I didn't. I've been training this new guy since Friday -- last Friday. And uh, he's doing pretty good. I'll probably be out with him for a few weeks and then I getting my job back in the shop. And I'm -- this is moving up and down 'cause I got my laptop on my lap, or will. You just have to bounce with me.My wife and I ordered a new Christmas present for the both of us. Uh, we've never had a Nintendo Wii so there was a special, uh, -- what's it called -- that Cyber Monday sale thing? And we ordered a Nintendo Wii with all kinds of extra stuff. And we should be getting it soon. Ordered a few games. Got our Christmas shopping done with -- well, almost.And there was something else I wanted to talk about. but I forgot what it was. It was cold and rainy outside today. Huh. Uh, my back hurts. What's new? Uh, my laptop -- it kinda took a shit on itself -- my old laptop. Ah -- my wife tried to take it to the IT tech at her work and have him look at it and he couldn't fix it. She brought it back home and I fixed it. So I gave it to her. So she got a perfectly fine laptop for free. Uh, YouTube rap music video, I've got the track -- I got all that done. The music's done. Now I've gotta put the video together. I've started putting bits and pieces together, but I still gotta record my part. But, uh, I still want you all's clips. If you all wanna send me any clip. A lot of you all might've taken that video the wrong way where I said send me any clips. I've had a couple people say can I send you anything, can I -- can I send you some music? No, it's a music video. It's my music, my lyrics, my song. I'm singing it and I just want clips of you, like, random clips of you blogging. To talking to the camera, doing driving blogs, uh. Anything from your previous videos which is simply short, like, looking at the camera, crossing your eyes or sticking your tongue out. Just anywhere from, like, two to five seconds long. 'Cause I'm gonna have random clips, like, shoot across the screen or something like that, whatever. But, um. So something simple like that. And if you're lucky I might throw on another preview on the -- at the end of this video. Like, just a little short clip of the song, the finished song -- if you're lucky. Now we're just gonna be cheesy.Uh -- you know -- I can't think of anything else to talk about right now. What I was gonna talk about -- there was something else I wanted to talk about, but I can't remember and I'll probably remember as soon I finish editing this video and get it ready to upload. I'll probably remember then.If I do I'll just write it over in the description -- sample or I'll make another video tomorrow. But, uh, yeah -- that's it for now. I'm gonna try to start blogging a little more. But I just haven't -- haven't really felt like it lately. I haven't -- I just haven't had -- just haven't felt like blogging. I haven't really had much to talk about. But, uh, I guess that is it for now and I'll talk to you all later. This video goes out to all my payers. Immature small penis wanna be dictators. If you don't like my cheesy ass rap song you can just go suck a dick all day long. Just think of YouTube; it's been so much fun. If I've never found the internet, what would I've done? What I've done if I've never found the internet -- I'd probably be sitting here staring at the TV set. I would've never been or called a newb. I would've never found this community on YouTube.

"VLOG396","﻿So Christina asked us to talk about our first computer. Basically, my dad has had a computer in our house my whole life and my parents would use it for like writing their sermons and stuff, so it made sense for them to have one. And my earliest use of the computer was to play games like the Aladdin computer game. I remember I had a lot of fun with that one; there was another one the Toy Story computer game and I remember having, um, Where in the World is Carmen San Diego, the computer game.When we lived in Minnesota my neighbors had the Indian Jones Atlantis game. I remember playing that; I loved that game and then they also had a game that was put together similarly, but it was a game about these tentacles that took over the world; how you got to actually travel forward and backward in time; to like save the world from the tentacles.In elementary school I remember we got like computer time; like our computer class every like week. We would play weird games likes, um, the name of the game was Thinking Things. I remember that had Thinking Things One, Thinking Things Two, Thinking Things Three and like you got to play like different games within it; and I remember there was like Reading Rabbit from like when we were learning how to read. And like different games like that.I just found it was like really fun stuff. I remember when we first got the internet I think I was like eight years old when we got the internet. Yeah, I remember it would take like a day for the email to get from your computer to their computer. So, it was just weird and I would say definitely a lot has changed since I got my first computer. Although it's still the Mac. It's still the Mac; it's a much better Mac.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG397","Hey, this is gonna be my second video blog and I figured since I skipped out on introductions on the first one and immediately started complaining about my dorm mates I should let you all know a little bit about myself.Um. As I said in my first blog, my name is XXXX, XXXX like music. There is an interesting story behind that. My father is a musician. My mother is tacky. They thought it would be good to name me XXXX. It's a nice name so I can't complain. And it rhymed. Anyways, um. I'm a freshman in college, I won't tell you which college I'm going to for the sake of privacy, but I am a freshman planning to graduate in two thousand and twelve. Um. My major is Art with the focus on illustration. I drew this, it's pretty isn't it? And I am obsessed with reading, the internet, video games even though I suck at them, and arty stuff in general. And I am eighteen and taken, so bad.And I think that's about it. Now that would be a really short blog so I guess I should talk about something else. Let's see here. I will talk about vampires because I've recently read a vampire novel by one second -- uh, by Amanda Ashley. This is one a series I think and it's called, 'Night's Kiss'. It's totally a housewife's novel you know, the romance, and the scary, and the danger but everything ends well at the end. It's definitely a housewife's novel, which makes sense 'cause I got it from my mother.And I am also um, this is the first season of True Blood, this has just finished. And I honestly think it is probably one of the awesomest things ever. And I was really interested in seeing because first I watched True Blood and then I read this, and in both of them silver can hurt vampires. I found that actually very interesting that more than one author thought that, um, silver can hurt vampires, because the True Blood series is based on the Sookie Stackhouse books written by some lady but apparently I'm supposed to read them immediately so I'm probably going to be stealing them from a friend shortly. And also everyone has been doing it, everyone has been talking about Twilight for some way in or another, and really it lost -- I lost all respect for the books because -Oh hey, my dorm mate's coming back. Hi. I'm doing a video blog.Oh, you are?YeaCooAnyway, so anyways, my -- I lost all respect for the author when I found out that Twilight was an allegory for waiting until marriage and how women are horrible temptresses because you know in the book Bella is totally into Edward and Edward's telling her to go away and all that crap and also because vampires sparkle. Now I got into an argument with a classmate in my English class saying that vampires don't sparkle they radiate, they radiate light. Sorry sweetheart, they sparkle. And honestly the entire thing seems like so horribly Mary Sue to me that I just -- I can't read more than I already have, being in bookstore, picking it up and flipping through some pages. Um. I guess that's a long enough blog then. Nice meeting you and I'll talk to you guys again.","Low","High","High"

"VLOG400","Okay. And my brain basically -- it was too much. And I do get over stimulated to where my -- I get like tunnel vision or just anxiety that's -- I don't know, anyway. Um, and, um, I do remember sensations. I remember some pressure, like a squeeze around my arm. I remember my arm being pulled. And I remember being um, dragged off the bus, my legs somehow keeping up with being pulled.And then being stood right in front of the individual who I had, um, yelled at at. And I remember this huge, gigantic, in my perception, woman, um, thirty five feet tall, um, looking down at me and going, You, apologize right now.  I also remember my bladder giving way around that moment. Um, and so I -- I remember saying something maybe like, oh no, I'm sorry.And, uh, then, um, I -- this is more of a faint memory, but I think the same person grabbed me and took me back onto the bus and sat me down, but it was right next to this girl that I don't think she stayed sitting next to me. Go figure. Um, that perhaps there's a little logic. Perhaps I was having one of those really, um, trying to -- like those little adolescent, prepubescent, uh, compulsions to try to show off for a girl. One of those idiotic moments which, um, probably is rather common.Um, but, anyway, yeah, I sat and I rode home that day with my soiled pants and got off the bus, went home and then the next day, um, I was called to the principal's office, and he was very calm, actually quite polite. He asked me if I knew why I was there and I said -- I did. I assessed why I was there and he said -- so he told me that we're going to go visit the individual that I had told that to.Now, um, back then I would've been the younger version of this, didn't have these on, didn't have any corrective lenses yet. Um, but he told me as I was going and he said -- he looked down at me and he said, You're going to apologize. I want you to meet this boy.  He said, Now he might behave a little differently, but um, I want you to, um, know that he's -- he said something like I want you to know he's just another boy just like you -- as you,  or something like that. And I'm like, okay.And, um, so I remember him standing there with him and the feeling as though we were holding hands, but I don't know if we were. I just felt like I anchor onto people when I'm nervous, or just even going out to the mall or whatever, I will anchor, like really focus on people, sort of energetically latch onto them as though I'm sort of archly or energy wise holding their hand. Sort of like holding onto their energy. So, maybe at that age I was already doing that, because that's what my memory feels like.And I remember the door opening and the instructor calling to the boy and the boy coming up to the door and looking at me and this boy, um, didn't look at me with anger or a scowl. This boy looked at me with a sort of smile. Um, but of -- with concern, and I looked at the boy and I said um, I just said I'm sorry, you know, and before I could do anything, I was being hugged by this other little boy. And back then I was -- I remember like standing stiff, kinda rigid, but also -- all I felt was acceptance. And, uh, respect, um, pretty unconditional. Not -- so, anyway, that was very, very touching obviously.Um, it's two o-eight. Let's see what time I got here. And it gave me my first kind of realization of how incorrect these other persons were to tell me that this person was retarded. And in no way shape or form of retardo. Perhaps in ways I'm far more enlightened, soul was in a body. Um, so anyway, that experience has stuck with me for years. It'll probably be with me 'til I leave this body and probably eternally to some degree.Um, so I feel the energies of others, strongly. Sympathizing, though when they do something of their own choice, um, that probably has consequences that aren't healthy for them or whatever, um, I -","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG401","﻿Hey, um, YouTube. I am on my mother's laptop right now. Um, she's currently letting me use it for the weekend, which is amazing. So I get to make videos with her really cool webcam, which is so much better than mine, I think. Um, starting to cover up this area because I'm laying on my bed. Um, I'm pretty bored right now. Um, I should go to bed, but I kind of don't want to. You know how that goes.Um, so I went to the beach and I've got a little color on my face, and right here on my -- .

Just to lay down.My cat is actually right over here. She right there. Say hi, Tina. You are on YouTube. I actually don't think she cares about YouTube so, blah, goes to show you how cats are.

"VLOG403","﻿Yeah, let's just skip all the excuses and head straight to the sketch. So, the other day I was in New York before my class and I was thirsty, whatever, so I went and got a coffee at a deli -- where I at least tried to get a coffee at a deli. I went into the deli, tried to get this lady's attention, by saying excuse me, excuse me, how much is your coffee? And she was all -- so I told him, I'd better not see you with Kayla again or else I will cut you. So I continued to try and get her attention, excuse me, excuse me, right over here, right in front of your face. How much is your coffee? How much is it? Hello girl, I don't play around. Oh my God, girl, I was just thinking that. Holy shit! We're like twins or something. We can read each other's minds. I know, it's happened to me twice.Finally, after waving my hands in the air and making some loud noises, clapping, not really that loud, but you know what I mean, she finally answered. Oh, hold on, hold on, one second more, we got you know -- shit! It's one twenty five. Yeah, you're sure that person's not him. Yeah, Edgar . No, no ho ho, blondish kind of. Girl, don' t you dare dye your hair blond, no. So I'm standing there, taking it, as her and her friend on the phone make fun of me in front of my face and then try and say okay, I'll have a coffee please, and she's still not answering. She's still straight up ignoring me even though she's looking at me and picking out my flaws and telling them to her friend. Oh, I should've .Please, it's always the same. The carpet matches the rug. Look at Lindsay Lohan. I know. What happened to her? She's done . My God, I saw like a rainbow. Finally, she noticed that I was doing this again and she did this. Ha, alright I'll -- hold on. Yeah, yes it's back. That'll be a dollar twenty five. Yeah, look, no, shut up girl. Oh my God! You didn't, you didn't. So the manager, who I guess was there the whole time in the back, comes to the front of the counter, whatever, and I try to be, you know, witty and straight up tell him that his employees suck and they say I guess she got an important phone call and he just does this. Just stared, just stared at me like I was in the wrong, after his employee rudely, like, wasted five minutes of my life when I could've got a coffee that quickly -- like this. Geez, I mean it's a store. I'm sorry for interrupting your conversation about cutting people, but I just wanted to purchase a coffee, since this is a deli and that's what you do, you know. Gosh, New Yorkers, as if you don't have a bad reputation already. 'Til next time folks, I'll see ya in a month. No, hopefully not. Bye.","High","High","High"
"VLOG404","What's up guys? It's Friday, and I have to tell you guys about this song that has been stuck in my head. Let's see -- how did it go? So I put my hands up, they're playing my song. The butterflies fly away -- no wait that wasn't it. Um, what was it, something like, ponyo, ponyo, ponyo tiny little fish, she's a little fish in the deep blue sea. Yeah, that sounds much better, right?For those of you who haven't heard it, it is a new movie from Japanese artist Hayao Miyazaki, who is amazing; pure, pure amazing talent that is hard to come by even in the animation industry, when you had people from Disney and all that stuff. He is just so amazing. Now if you have heard of it, you most likely have heard that Noa Cyrus, who is Miley's little sister, and Frankie Jonas, the bonus Jonas, are doing voices in the movie; which for some of you I know out there is like amazing -- oh my God, like oh my God, it's Frankie Jonas -- but for some of you, you might not see it because of that, because it's another movie from Disney that, oh it's another Cyrus, it's another Jonas and stuff like that, so you might not go and see it.Here is where I hope you find a turning point. First of all, they are not the only voices in the movie. You have Tina Faye and Liam Neeson are also big voices that are in it, and that is pure amazing. I love the both of them; I love Liam Neeson as an actor, he is amazing. Second of all, it's not your average Disney movie. Some of you might recognize the name Miyazaki from the movie Spirited Away, which is another one of his works, which became really popular in the United States.The thing is is they all start in Japan because he is a Japanese artist and he works in Japan. All the movies he makes start in Japan. The only reason they have the Disney tag on them is because the Disney company is the one who produces them for the United States into an English version; they do the English dubbing over them and then distribute them into the U. S. ; that's the only reason that they have the Disney dub on them. So it's not an average Disney movie.We all have to admit that Disney movies are very good, especially a lot of the animated ones, but if you're not big into all that Disney stuff, this really isn't a Disney movie. It is done in Japan and it is done by one of the greatest animators and story writers ever, in my opinion; so that's another reason.Other movies that have been done by Hayao Miyazaki which I love include Porco Rosso, Nausicaa and the Valley of the Winds, Spirited Away; like I said; Howl's Moving Castle; and Princess Mononoke and one of my favorites, My Neighbor Totoro. That's another thing is My Neighbor Totoro along with Ponyo are two movies that look like they are made for children, which is true. Hayao Miyazaki focuses on movies that are made for children; more -- like more or less. He does. But the thing is I got into these movies when I was about sixteen. I was sixteen when I first saw my first Miyazaki movie and I fell in love with it; and I did I fell in love with everyone I saw. The first one I saw was Howl's Moving Castle, which has one of my favorite actors as a voice actor, Christian Bale. Oh my gosh, and it was amazing. It is so good and it is just really great. And that's one of those ones where it's kind of not really like just a children's story; like, as a teenager, as an adult, you can even appreciate it. Trust me.And that's how a lot of his movies are; like Spirited Away was one; Princess Mononoke is another one of those; Nausicaa and the Valley of the Winds, Porco Rosso -- kind of have a deeper sort of story going to them that older minds can appreciate it. Even My Neighbor Totoro, being a sort of children friendly movie because it has a little -- the characters are very young, which they're, um, voiced by Dakota Fanning and her younger sister, whose name currently escapes me, but even so, it's just a -- it's a heartwarming story that you see in that film that any age can really appreciate it. Also, Totoro is this big giant forest spirit who is absolutely adorable, but then again, I'm a girl and I say adorable way too many times per day. It's awful.So that's what I'm expecting from Ponyo, I've seen the trailers; it looks like typical Miyazaki which is fantastic. It looks very child oriented because you have younger main characters, which is what he usually has. Anyways, they're usually younger if they're not children; they're more teenagers, I -- I would say. They look like they're in their teens. There is one that is definitely an adult, more or less. But even so, even though it has younger children as the more, like, the protagonist in this movie, it looks like it's gonna have that more serious storyline to it that anyone can appreciate it, children and adults alike. Because you know there are going to be a lot of adults that are taking their children to go see this, but I think they won't be disappointed. And trust me, no matter what age you are, you more than likely will not be disappointed.Miyazaki is such a great story teller, a great animator; like the animation is always superb and it's just so good and I really really say go see it. I'm going to see it as soon as possible. That most likely won't be today, even though it comes out today, but I'm gonna go and see it as soon as I can. And you know who else says you should go and see it? Totoro. Totoro says you should go see it. Yeah, this is how much I love this movie, I have a Totoro pillow. Totoro says you should go see it and so do I. So go see it.And if you think for one second I'm being paid to do this, you've got to be kidding me. I am not that popular on YouTube; are you kidding me? I just do these silly little vlogs; I am not being paid to do this. That is absolutely ridiculous. I'm just doing this because I wanted to do a vlog because I haven't done one in 10 days. And because, you know, with Ponyo coming out today, I wanted to talk about something that I love, which is Miyazaki and his movies; like, they're just -- they're so good, I really love them. And I'm not kidding when I say that no matter what age, you can appreciate them. The friend that gave them to me to borrow to watch is my age, and he still watches them and he still loves them. And they're just -- they're really good. Trust me. You won't be disappointed. And if you are, I will apologize. I know, I know, like, this certain animation might not fit everyone's styles, but if you really do like his stuff, you won't be disappointed. They're always very well done and I'm so excited that there is finally another Miyazaki movie, because I was hoping and waiting for it to come out. So I'm very excited.So you should go see it if you get the chance, just -- just see it. Okay, I'm done, I'm done; this vlog is done. Bye..","High","Low","High"
"VLOG405","So -- I'm now gonna have a -- sorry about that. I'm now gonna have a categorized video sort of thing. There's gonna be a news section, a gaming section, a film section perhaps, and other sections. And that's how I'm gonna roll from now on, perhaps I'm gonna do it. So, yeah. So here it is. Here's the news.So, I came in this morning you know, I was gonna go to the petrol station, grab a drink, go see the missus. You know, get on my bike as normal. Riding off and I think oh, steering feels real weird. Next thing I thought yeah, I'll come back home, check the tires. Check the front tire, that's fine, I'm thinking all right, I'll check the back tire. Bloody flat. Ooh yes. So I thought okay, get the bike up on a centre stand, slowly pushing the wheel around, I see this tiny little bloody pin which turned out to be a tiny little pipe which really pissed me off, you know no Squeaky to ride on, no biking videos, fuck you know?Gaming news. I went and ordered Operation Flashpoint and Dragon Rising off Steam today and let me tell you that game is such a disappointment. I expected more like a hell of a lot of people on the forum did as well. If Steam could do a refund I'd want one, I want a refund for this game. Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising is about the fucking worst disappointment I've had ever. You know they claim oh yes, it's gonna be better than Armed Assault Two, you know those people oh, it's gonna be better than Armed Assault Two. It's not, plain and simple. Yes Armour two does have it's faults and glitches but yes, but do you hear me at interactive studios they do work then they've bollocked off, and they've got such a big community of fans that you go on the server that they've modded the game files so much, the game's bloody well enjoyable. You go on Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising you know, dedicated server, fuck it, I couldn't bloody find one. I kept on losing connection, you know for no reason. I'm on sixty megabites for Christ sake you know, I'm six hundred and twenty meters away from the telephone exchange, you know and I'm losing connection. What? What's up with that. You know that game is crap. So if you're ever thinking about buying Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising, don't, it is shit.Other gaming news. Lepider two is out soon. Fair news. The demo if you've pre ordered it should be out tomorrow, Tuesday the twenty seventh of October so I will be playing that, because I've pre ordered it for me and the missus. Also if you like Lepider and Lepider two may I interest you in Killing Floor which you already might have and see if you've watched more of their thirteen video about Killing Floor but that is one bloody good game. It is basically a bit like Lepider two and Counterstrike. So you've got ten waves of specimens 'cause they're not zombies they're specimens. And the eleventh wave is the Patriarch which is like the main part but at the end of every wave you've got a trader which is this half caste woman who lives in a shed at different locations she spawns up. And you go to like the trader, press e or wherever you've got it binded at, and you can buy weapons such as rifles, sub machine guns, or whatever, grade launchers or whatever could someone open -Whatever. So yeah. I guess you're gonna like it because that is bloody brilliant. They've had two of a content which had four extra playable cards in each, the first one was one pound forty nine I think it was and the second one was ninety nine p. Ninety nine p, who can resist, who can say no? I didn't and I bought it. So I think that will do for the gaming news for now which I am ranting on a bit too much about because I my movie news to do so, yeah.Movie news. I went to see Zombieland. Rarr. Zombieland. Yeah. I really enjoyed that film. You know, the -- I forgot his fucking name now. Bill Murray, yeah that's the geezer. Bill Murray made a cameo appearance. He was -- he played his part well. Overall a good zombie flick, go and see it. Now what else.Transformers Two. Ugh. What could I say. They tried and they failed. It was crap. It's okay if you're watching it when you're stoned or you're pissed but that's about it. So yeah, that's my movie news for now.Other news. I told you about the squeak, did I tell you about squeaky with his back tire. Squeaky being my moped. In other news as well, I bought off Amazon, Season of Rot by Eric S. Brown. Brown. Brooown.

That's really it for my other news. So yeah, that's about it for my other news now, so. . . I won't be doing any motor bike or moped blogs any more, well, until after Christmas. And that's about it.

"VLOG409","It has also been non scientifically proven that big men likes facial hair. You're also welcome.La, la, la , La, la, la, La, la, la, , la, la, la, .Hey darling, so I'm kinda glad that you apparently like this thing that's going on around here. It makes it almost seem worth it. The real reason I'm actually doing this, guys, if you haven't, like, followed my Twitter or my Daily Booth or anything like that; I'm taking part in what they call Movember. It's pretty much a month long event in which guys grow their mustaches and facial hair to raise money to raise awareness for prostate cancer.Obviously, this is my first time, like properly growing out any form of facial hair. So it's gonna take a few more practice runs because the mustache isn't really there, hence the chin stuff to sort of even out the balance. Really, my face is just a bit awkward. Anyway, like I said, I'm raising money. So obviously, it's based on sponsors. I've got a donation page on the Movember website, link in the sidebar. Again, if you haven't been following me on Daily Booth, I have a proposal for people who donate. Anyone who donates any form of money to my page can leave a message in which they can leave me a challenge. And I said that for every twenty pounds I raise, I'll do one of the challenges that has been set for me in a video.It's just another little event to get you guys involved, because you know what, it's for charity and men's health is really important. But men, you'd better make the most of this for the time being, because in about a week, there's gonna be an event where I'm going with some of my workmates. We're just gonna sorta compare mustaches and have a bit of a shave off.So, yeah, this time next week, this will be gone, sorry. So yesterday was our eighteen month anniversary, or mensiversary, as people like to continuously correct us. So happy anniversary. darling. I'm glad that the eight ball said that we're going to work out because, as you know, I totally put my faith in those things.I'm just going to bring up a quick point from the comments and XXXX last video. Now, as you know, she actually got the question as to what we should do for our eighteen month anniversary. What neither of us were expecting was a badge of comments of people saying go to Scotland, or XXXX, go to Australia or meet each other halfway. Now, guys, you do realize the anniversary was yesterday and XXXX posted her video like, four days ago, which doesn't really give us that much time to just jump on a plane. Believe me, if we were made of money, we would probably be doing these things on a regular basis anyway. So if people can't really grasp the fact that we're not just setting off to the ends of the planet for the good of our health, it can get a little bit frustrating. Now, I don't want to get all huffy and oversensitive about the subject, but you know, if we're gonna make this channel work, then you guys have to realize that there are a lot of very good reasons why me and XXXX aren't together right now.Anyway, subject change. XXXX, you mentioned that it was a normal thing in your childhood for guys to wink at you. Well, I'd scratch my beard, because that's really weird. Well not weird per se, it's just something that I didn't grow up with myself. It probably doesn't help that Britain is like the second most paranoid country in the world. There is just no trust between strangers and kids. The media is constantly out to scare kids and their parents about strangers. Anyway, the point I'm trying to say is the only stranger that would ever or to, wink at kids would've been someone in a Santa suit, actually, now that you think about it.Oh, God. I'm just going to wrap this up with some questions before it gets gross. One, what's the weirdest thing you've ever done for charity? Two, if money wasn't a real issue for you, would you just want to instinctively run around the world or would you be a bit more level headed with it? And three, ? Looking forward to seeing your answers in the comments, and XXXX, I'm looking forward to seeing your new next video. See you guys.[LA1]This is a singer in a recorded song.","High","High","Low"

Did you know that one thousand and ninety seven years ago today, Thisalso the Great was born and later became the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire? Hum, not quite. And fifty four years ago today, Stephen Birst was born. To be honest, I've never heard of him before. You too? Yeah, right. Um, can we get like, I don't know, uh Pitch Elvin . Yeah, yeah, okay, okay, like a picture of him, just a picture of his face for the -- the cam -- it's on, it's rolling. Here you go. Yeah, there he is Stephen Birst.

He later created and does all the voices in the British TV series, Fonejacker. Nineteen years ago, British author Roald Dahl, writer of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which also does candy and stuff, not just chocolate -- it's a bit misleading -- anyway, he died. Aw. Seventeen years ago today, American actress and singer -- ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Miley Cyrus, was born. And fifteen years ago today I popped out of a woman, who's now known as my mother.

"VLOG411","Hi. um, I'm just wanted to make this video because I went and saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, and I just wanted to talk about it, so here we go. If you haven't seen the movie you might want to stop watching right now.So my mum and I go to the movies to see Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. We're going to see the ten o'clock showing, but it was sold out by the time we got there, so we ended up going to the ten forty five show. So we sat there in line for, er, roughly forty five minutes. First of all, it was a really long time and I hate waiting, so hhmm. By the time we get in there, my mum was like oh, go get us a refill, and I'm like, but, but come on, what if it starts without me and stuff like that 'cause it almost did. Um, yeah, and when I was in there, so the first thing I thought was kind of weird was that I was sitting there just -- kind of just sitting there when we first got in there, some random guys just like -- just like walked past, um, the row we were sitting on singing What's My Age Again by Blink one eighty two. I just thought it was kind of weird. So when we gotten -- so we're in the movie, it started, we're all like yay, um, I'm gonna go see Holmes when it comes out, and something else probably. Um, I don't know what else. And, um, so we were watching it um first all, let me just mention that, um, I barely remember any of the sixth book 'cause I read it like last year I think. That is when I finally finished it, um, and it was just so boring. I was just kind of bored 'cause, well, it -- it was -- since it was so long they had so much extra stuff in there that they didn't really need and it's just amazing how they've put all that stuff in two and a-half hour movie that kind of made it better than the seven to eight hundred page book. So, I liked it overall. Um, Tonks hair didn't change color at all in this movie, I'm serious. It normally just, ye, it was like the same color the entire movie. I was not happy. Um, and we've got -- and I guess it's better than the fifth one -- the fifth book. Basically, Harry just whines, sits there and whines and is all mopey and kind of annoying. Um, yeah. So, um, I really did like it. Um, I've said that several times because I really did, and um I -- gosh, I have no clue what to say now. All I know that I really hated about it was that I had to wait in line and we're lucky we got good seats, um, we did, because um, I felt really sorry for the people behind us in line because they had been there like for like forever, but they went to the wrong place to stand in li -- to si -- well they -- they sat outside there and somebody comes over and tells them that they're in the wrong li -- they're not in the line, and ye, I felt sorry for them. Oh my God, what's wrong with my hair today, or okay everyday? I'm just gonna fix my hair. Fixing. Er, come on, my hair. Okay. That did not work. Whatever. Um yeah, so like I said, can't remember rest of the sixth book, but I don't think that entire lo -- I don't think the Lavender and Ron sub plot was actually in the book. I can't remember. I vaguely remember the name Lavender Brown, but not sure where from. Um, but it was very interesting, um, so yeah, not really much else to say there. Um, ye, so I recommend it. Everybody go watch it. Just go see it 'cause it's awesome and you know, awesome. Yeah, so, bye.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG412","Hey, this is XXXX with one A, and when I got home today, holy shit, my video has a lot of views and comments, and all in under one day. So, I understand that a lot of you still don't get why I made that video. Well, allow me to explain why you shouldn't care about the Kanye West and Taylor Swift incident. And no, I'm not making a video, because I care that Kanye West dissed Taylor Swift on stage. I couldn't care less; I've got better things to do than worry about celebrities all the time. I'm just mad because people care about this incident too much.So, Taylor Swift wins the award for best video, and after she made her speech, Kanye West goes up on stage, takes the mic and goes, hey, I'm happy for ya, and I let you finish, but let me just say that Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time -- of all time. Ahh, who cares? Is it really that bad that you people have to throw this huge fuss over it? You people are over reacting, and you know it. And just how do we know that you're over reacting? Well, you've been looking busy about this incident in your Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube videos and YouTube comments. In fact, if you posted a stupid comment below, you're just proving my point that people care about this incident just a little bit too much.I mean, just think about it. Look yourself in the mirror, and ask yourself am I a little bit too obsessed with these celebrities? The answer for many of you is yes. But, why? There's so much bigger problems in this world to worry about, and we're going to worry and get angry over one celebrity dissing another on stage? Big whoop.I mean, let's forget about the real problems in this world, like poverty, starvation, crimes, wars, pollution, bad rap music, people going homeless, people losing their jobs, people getting killed, and these diseases plaguing your fucked up minds. Oh no, Kanye West dissing Taylor Swift on stage is so much more worse than that. What shall we do?I'll tell you what to do, you need to let this incident go and move on with your pathetic life. Geez, don't you people have anything better to do than follow these celebrities and their lives all the time? How about worrying about your own problems in your own personal life, first? Seriously, people are just mad because they are popular celebrities, it's Kanye West and Taylor Swift. If they were two Average Joe's then nobody would give a rat's ass about this incident, and you know it. And yes, Kanye West is a douche bag, but let him be a douche bag, that is his problem, not ours.I mean, you people aren't helping the situation at all, by being mad at Kanye West and kissing Taylor Swift's ass. Because these two celebrities, honestly, don't give a fuck. They're celebrities, they live in their own little world, and they don't even know that all the over dramatic bad boys and bad girls even exist. So, what's the point? What's the point of supporting a celebrity so bad, if they don't even know who the fuck you are? It's not like you people are going to get rewarded for being mad at the situation, so just drop it and move on. Because, I'm sure both Kanye West and Taylor Swift will make up, and get over this. So, why don't you people follow the example and do the same?Grow up, and learn how to let things go. And don't dwell on the past over some over dramatic bullshit, like some fucking, five year old crybaby. And that goes, not just for celebrities, but to all you people in people in real life situations as well.And lastly, it doesn't matter if this bullshit happened at some MTV music VMA awards show. It doesn't matter that this happened in front of millions of people and some live audience, because this incident could have happened anywhere, and to anyone, not just celebrities and people need to learn how to take criticism and to defend themselves if they're heckled on stage. If that was me, I'd be like, bitch, I'm the one with the reward, not you. In your face.So, in conclusion, people are just being over dramatic crybabies about this incident and they need to let go and move on. Worry about your own life and worry about the world's real problems, and stop worrying about all these celebrities all the time. Because, I can tell you this, these celebrities sure don't care about you. So, have fun crying and being mad over someone who doesn't even know you exist.So, you know I have a lot of fans and viewers out there, and I'm sure a lot of you love and agree with this video, but I'm sure there's a lot of you who don't like this video too, and once again, that's your problem, not mine. Because, I'm just speaking the truth and I'm telling it how the fuck it is. And a lot of you just can't handle the truth, can you? Oh well. But you know what, I believe in free speech, and I think everyone has the right to express their opinions without being censored. So, I'll ask, what do all of you people think about this incident? Post your comments in the comments section below and we can have a debate, if you still haven't moved on with your life yet.Anyway, this is XXXX with one A, and that's all I have to say about that. Peace out.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG413","Hello. So it's Wednesday night about two in the morning and I have to go to bed. But I was sitting around thinking, I should probably make a video today because tomorrow I'm going to the mountains all day and then Friday, I've got a lot to do and this weekend is crazy. And I thought I'd just kinda talk to your guys 'cause I -- I feel that my updates always have an agenda -- there's always a purpose, there's always a reason, but this is just losing weight the hard way, weigh in number something seventy four, seventy six, something. My God, do you realize that's like -- I mean, hello, that's almost like eighty weigh ins? It's just ridiculous how long this process gets.Anyway, I just wanted to make a video because I've had a very good week and I wanted to share with you that I'm doing really well. I feel like I've really gotten away from the whole idea of weekly weigh ins which is to communicate with the community. I -- I don't respond to a lot of comments on my videos anymore. The focus is so much more on below the yellow line and the editing and the creativity. It's really a creative outlet for me right now. I'm not really sewing, I'm really not painting, I'm not drawing, I'm not doing really anything artistic and below the yellow line for it to be like this huge creative outlet for me.Um, when I edit, I just sort of go into this new place. And I -- I have a lot of fun. So I realize I've sort of gotten away from what the community was about for me which is about connecting with you all and telling you how I am -- not giving you grocery , not teaching you about a new diet, to answering questions or doing a Q and A, not um, you know, video, um, documentary style, but like blogging .Anyway, I just -- you know, the whole idea of Jess' challenges this week was to look in the mirror until you've found something you love about yourself. And, I don't need to do that, because I already really myself in so many ways.But sometime tonight during blog TV, I realized I said something aloud and I didn't even realize it 'til I said it aloud. But I said something to the affect of, most people spend their time at work thinking about how they're missing out on their life, on their time with their friends, on their time doing what they love. But I am one of those people who is blessed to be doing nothing but what they love all the time.As a result, however, I tend to find that when I spend time with my friends, I get that feeling that you usually get at work. I get that feeling of, I'm missing out on work. I'm not getting things done and it stresses me out. I don't want to be like that. As much as I love my job, I don't want to be so preoccupied with it that I can't enjoy time with my friends. So that was kind of a thing that I thought about and that really has started me on this new path.Um, in the last few hours -- the last week has really been about me embracing more than my job in my life. And so, um, and I've been thinking about that because that's what Jess has for the challenge this week -- um, or week four. I don't know it's week five, week four. I'm always behind or off a week -- whatever. That was the last video I watched of hers and that's what I've been thinking about. Um, so it's probably week five now and I'm all off, but anyway. I've just been thinking how wonderful a lot of things are going. Uh, how wonderfully a lot of things are finally going for me and that's why I wanted to share.I feel like um, since I moved to California, it was almost, like, my whole life got put on hold for a couple of months and I've been playing catch up since then. I've been incredibly stressed out -- more than I've ever been in my life. I've been going through a lot of emotional changes, um.Jason's helped me realize this is the first time I have been single, really single, for a long stretch of time, since high school. I've always been in a relationship. A lot of the times I've been in a long term relationship and um, I was single for while, but I had, you know, little boyfriends or guys I was seeing the whole time. This is the first time that I'm just sort of single and I'm not really meeting people and I don't really care to. I just want to be single. I like it and it's different and it's scary and it's alo -- lonely sometimes, but it's wonderful.You know it really allows me to spend time to come into who I am . That's one big shift. The other one is that I'm -- I'm really finally caught up with all my work. Um, I've just been so behind, you know, on work. Basically because I've missed work for, like, two months. I kinda did whatever was absolutely necessary during the move, you know, just to keep the business going. But I didn't do anything above and beyond that. And then, I spent months and months and months playing catch up. And now I'm finally, you know, just doing what needs to be done. I don't feel behind. I don't feel, like I'm terribly, um, failing at getting my work done.Um, the first full book that I ever published came in the mail today -- the first draft. But it only has, like, one Post it filled with edits to do for the whole book to be done. This is my first book I've ever designed. Um, it's not in print, obviously, but that's it. Um, I'm so proud of it.You know, I've always said I'm a graphics designer. I've always done graphic design, but you know, there's something really significant about being a publisher and designing a whole book and having it be done. There's no words -- it feels, like, a year a year in progress. And it just -- it just looks beautiful. It's just -- it's wonderful. The index has to be done and there's a lot of work to be done. But it just looks really nice. I'm incredibly proud of my work on this book. I love the back of the cover especially. I got the spine width correct. Anybody who's a designer knows how wonderful it is when your work just turns out beautifully.Um, so work is going great and I've got new projects on the horizon. I feel like I'm almost caught up with the YouTube messages. I've got a few hundred left and I just need to kinda set aside time to do that. I think this weekend is going to be the time. And um, what else is there that's sitting out there? Oh, my blog. I'm shitweightloss. com. I'm always behind, but I've let it get really behind lately. What I should do is just friggin' update the blog when I upload a video, but I just never think of it.So -- but I do feel like everything is coming together. Work is coming together and it's getting back to normal. YouTube is coming together and it's getting back to normal.My life, I mean I'm finally eating healthy after, like, switching to raw foods right when I moved down here in California to then going crazy 100% raw and then completely falling off the deep end eating holy crap bad food for, like, a month. I'm finally coming back in um, to some sort of center. I'm eating raw the first half of the day and then I'm eating nonprocessed  for the second half of the day.And I'm exercising again. I'm running again. Monday I went for like a forty five minute walk and Tuesday I went for my run. Today I didn't do anything, but tomorrow I'm going walking all day in this little mountain town with lots of shops and stuff and then Friday or Saturday I'm going rock climbing and I'm going for another run. One of those -- whichever day I'm not going rock climbing I may go for another run.Um, I just -- I feel like everything's finally coming together and I -- I was just sitting here realizing, you know, I -- I've always wanted this life for I did what I loved and I had a lot of fun doing it and I had a practical budget. And way, that's another thing. My money's finally coming together after going completely haywire with my move. I just feel, like, I've always wanted this life and I suddenly, like, realized oh my God I have it. And now it's a matter of managing it. Um, but I'm there.You know, Greg always said to me I shouldn't work too hard. Um, something like -- don't burn yourself out and suddenly wake up and realize you're in your thirties and you've never had your twenties. Um, and he's right. You know, I -- I work really hard and I'm so ambitious. Sometimes I forget to just smile and realize how much I have.I'm twenty four. I work at home doing things I love all day, every day. I have this amazing community. I have amazing friends. I have this incredible family and I have an okay money situation. I'm incredibly blessed.So that's my belated Thanksgiving video. I am thankful for this life and I'm doing really well.Although my weight is not going down. It will eventually be going down. Um, this morning I weighed in at 166. 0 which would be a two pound loss in the last month. Um, but things are improving and I'm basically almost at goal again and that's what matters.So anyway, that's all I had to say. I'm just really happy and I wanted to give an update for this Thursday because I'm really not gonna have, um, time to make a video tomorrow.Bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG414","﻿Hey, guys. Totally just trying to make a blog. This is awkward for me, 'cause I haven't made a blog in a whileHey, let me just talk to an imaginary person. This camera's not gonna respond. It's just gonna get all weird, and it's gonna be like, you're an idiot.Hey, first totally something exciting that I should share with you guys. Totally have a job. That means I'm making money. I'm actually gonna be a tutor at my old middle school. I noticed that there is a big difference between when I was in middle school, and then the kids that are in middle school now.First of all, they're freaking tall. I feel like a midget. I mean, I was a midget when I was in middle school -- I was only like, four feet and eight inches -- I only grew, like, what, three inches since then, I don't know. I'm standing next to these like, five nine kids, and I'm like, I look like I'm four eleven, basically. And all these kids are like, um, you're my tutor? I'm like, yeah, nice to meet you.They have a laptop program at this school. I don't know if that's or what, but they're like -- I didn't need a laptop 'til I was in college, and I had been working for, like two to three years, I don't know. I don't really think a laptop is that necessary in middle school, but I guess times are a changing.Speaking of laptops, I'm taking notes with my laptop now, but this dude next to me had his laptop out, and was like, pounding away at the keys. It was like tappety, tap, tap so loud, like hey, can you, like, cut pillows on your fingers, like mini cotton balls or something, to like mute the sound of your little -- your fingers, so I can -- distracting.So yes. Along with that, I have also just started school. A lot of you guys have already been to school for, like, a few weeks, but I just started this week at my, uh -- at my university. I go to by the way. Hopefully, soon I will be graduating, if I pass all these classes and I'm, like, good to go. Since I am back in school, that means less time for making these videos and, um, I do apologize for that, but hey, I have a life too. I mean, I appreciate that you guys watch these videos, but you should get some sunshine.I might not have enough time to make videos, so if you guys are really that interested in whatever the heck I have to say, I did make a blog, d seven one two three blogspot dot com. Hopefully, it won't be too long before my next video, but in the meantime just check out the bloggy blog. And also, I promised Mika that I would say hi to her in a video, so hello Mika, thank you for the funnel cake that I've , you can make a .. Okay, lame.","High","High","High"
"VLOG415","﻿Hey, everyone. I'm going to try and make videos of me now and then on English. And it's not going to be, like, beginner beginner lessons, but, um, things that -- more phrases in English that you might not understand when people use them. And, for now, I have three phrases to share. And if you have any questions about English, you can just ask me, and I'll try my best to answer it.The first one is when someone says, The alarm went off.  Now, when I first heard this, it didn't make sense to me, because actually, the alarm is going -- is turning on. But in English, that -- you just don't say, The alarm turned on.  For some reason, you say, The alarm went off.  I don't have an explanation for this, but it's just one of those things, like, we say, My nose is running,  and, um, Your feet smell.  It's just weird. And then you could say the same for a sprinkler went off,  or the bomb went off. The next phrase is, um, turn off the light,  versus close the light.  Now, whenever you will hear a native English speaker say this, they would most probably say close the light.  It's one of the most common mistakes English speakers make. They would say, Close the light.  Close the TV.  Something like that. And -- but it's actually supposed to be turn off the light.  If you can remember to say, Turn off the light,  instead of close the light,  it would make you sound a lot more smarter. It's not like someone will tell you that you're wrong. Very few people know that, um, it's turn off the light,  not close the light.  This phrase is usually done with a lot of electronics, like, Close the TV.  But it is, Turn off the light.  The same goes for turn on the light.  It's not open the light.  It's turn on the light. The last one I have for now is keep me in the loop.  Sometimes when a friend or family member is going somewhere far off, um, they would -- they would tell you, Keep me in the loop.  Which basically means, keep me aware, let me know, keep me -- keep in touch. Those kind of things. They all mean keep me in the loop.  So you can say all those things by saying, Keep me in the loop.  And I'm guessing this might have developed from the term friend circle.  That's just my guess; I'm not -- I don't know. For now, that's all I have, so -- but if you have any specific questions, you can ask me through YouTube.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG416","﻿Hey guys, it's me XXXX. How are you guys today? Today's video is just a quick blog. What, it's like July eighth or something, yeah July eighth. It's nine thirty in the morning, and um, Amy just done taking me over to the doctors. Just took in my, um, my paper work for a disability, is that what it was? My disability paper work.Doctor put me out of work for a while. Saturday I go in -- this Saturday the eleventh, I go in for my um, I'm not sure if it's going to be my epidural shots, or my epidural consultation. My neurologist seemed to think I really need this and it's up to the, you know, the guy actually giving me the shots whether he's going to do them or not. So, yeah, my doctor put me out for a little bit and, um -- and we'll see what happens. All right, I'll keep you guys posted over here on Louis' B logging but, not really much else to say.Um, you know what I do have one more thing to say. Amy just went over to, uh -- this is actually funny. We went over to -- what's the name of that place?Panera BreaPanera Bread, aight. And of course you guys know, I got my coffee, right. Amy goes into Panera Bread and gets this drink. Who knew that the straws they give you from Panera Bread are that big? I mean, I hope -- I'm about to twitter this also, check the Twitter post -- but that straw is ama -- I mean that is huge. C'mon, I would say that's almost a half inch in diameter. I mean is it 'cause they want you to finish the drink that fast? It's not 'cause the drink is that thick, but I just thought I'd let you guys know. I mean, this thing is hilarious. Amy came out with that big ass straw and I just had to -- she says you twitter everything else, you gotta twitter the size of this damn straw.So I am. I'm going to go ahead and twitter that off, I think it'll be funny. Aight guys, that's pretty much it. I just wanna give you guys a head up on what's happening. Yes, I'm out of work for a while. Um, exactly how long, I don't know 'til my doctor gives me back this paper work he has to fill out for my work. And um, I'll keep you guys posted over here. All right, I'll definitely let you guys know what happens on Saturday when I get my shots -- and as always lots of love, lots of respect, alright? Peace.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG417","So you guys, I'm here and I have not forgotten about my channel. And I really want to thank all the new subscribers -- um -- that have subscribed to me since, uh, my last video. And, um, that was about Harvey Milk.And I want to make some updates about the news that Iowa has become the third state to legalize gay marriage on Friday on April third -- I think it was April third. And by unanimous vote they ruled a ban on gay marriage as unconstitutional and twenty one days after the ruling, which is April twenty fourth, licenses will be granted to same sex couples to get married. So that is amazing because you know, um, after propate -- I think there's a lot of movement now that, you know, this isn't right, you know, to ban gay marriage or to ban marriage for all -- like a certain group of people is not constitutional. I mean that's like separate but equal but it's not equal you know. So that was amazing that Iowa, out of a lot of states, amazingly, um, is the third state now along with Connecticut and Massachusetts.So other than that, um, I've been having a lot of fun. I went to a quinceanera, uh, quince anos which is a Spanish tradition for women of -- of the age of fifteen. It's kind of like a rite of passage -- um uh -- for women to become part of society and -- uh -- start dating and all that stuff. And it's like a birthday but it's like a sweet sixteen in Latin America. So that was pretty cool. I've never been to one and it was my third cousin's quinceanera. Yeah.And I went to a club yesterday also after that and it was really cool 'cause it was in the city and -- I haven't really been to clubs, I been more to bars but yeah it's really cool. Partying it up. Yes. And let's see what else.Um, I'm giving some shout outs to four channels. Um, one of 'em is, um, my channel that I, um, mostly vlog on because I do like a weekly vlog on the five complete strangers and there's also two, um, let's see -- there's Alex from the UK, there is Sam from Virginia and, um, there's -- what else -- oh -- the Alex from the US, uh, Louisiana, and then, um, then there's me for Thursday and then there's Chris for Friday. And that is the five complete strangers. And we usually have like a weekly theme. Um, so look forward to that. So subscribe to that if you haven't.And then there's another channel, um, Manny -- Manny Sole -- Manny. I just call him Manny. He steals my money. And this is a girl that asked me for help, uh, back in January -- like now -- like a week before like I made my video of coming out and, uh, she's great. She's made two videos and I think she's really under -- under hype because I know she's a new vlogger and I think she makes great vlogs and she'll probably make more vlogs if you guys subscribe so, um, I'll post a link in the video right now. Manny My Sole and I hope you guys like her channel.And then the other two are the guys from, uh, the five complete strangers, the new guys, which is Chris -- Chris -- anything west of Lincoln and Sam. Sam is crazy, awesome nineteen ninety. Um, so subscribe to those, you guys because, um, you'll be hearing more stuff about me and other people, um, usually on those vlogs.

"VLOG418","﻿Oh well, hey everyone. I am vlogging from inside of a car in Phoenix, Arizona, because I am there on a business trip. Pretty fun. Um, so this is kind of like an update video. All right, everyone sigh. All right, uh, we'll continue. I am sorry for not making a video in a while. I've been super busy. I bet the majority of you guys have as well, or maybe it's just me. I have -- I really -- I have a feeling that it's not just me, because school started this month, so if you're in college or returning to any type of schooling, um, the first month of September is always crazy.Especially for me. And I'm coaching soccer, too, which is great. If you follow me on Twitter, you'll know that I am very proud of my team. We're undefeated; it's under twelves. Uh, I love those kids. They watch my YouTube videos, too, so after, uh, practice, we'll go over how to do the gummy bear dance. It's really cute. We've done it a couple of times.Um, so thank you for everyone who sent in your questions. I have, um, a whole script written out. It's gonna be kinda different than maybe a normal question answer video. And I have a friend that's gonna be in it, so it's gonna be -- it's gonna be pretty fun. I'm filming -- I'm set to film that on Tuesday, so that's just really really exciting. I think you guys will enjoy it.Um, I have a few more videos coming out this month of October. We'll -- you'll see more of me than you did this -- that last month. I don't think I've ever not posted a video ever for like a whole month. Well, I mean, a while ago I had, but just for the month -- for the year of uh, o nine, hmm -- but I am in Phoenix and I've never been here before and it's -- as I look around -- like you guys can see what I'm seeing.All I can actually see is a wall right now. Yeah, just a wall, so that's just not probably the greatest view of Phoenix, but there is so much cactus everywhere. And like people don't have a lawn. Instead of having a lawn with grass, they have -- or I mean, they do have a lawn. Wait, what would it be called? A front yard? There you go. Instead of it being with grass, it's like dirt. That's the weirdest thing ever.I mean, there's probably going to be comments from people like, what, your front yard doesn't have dirt? And I'm gonna be like, no, it has grass. I'm from California. But then, there's probably gonna be other comments from people saying, I'm from California and I have a dirt front yard. I don't know, but it's just -- it's foreign to me. Okay, there you go, it's foreign to me. So there's cactuses everywhere, too.And it's -- the weather is surprisingly nice. Like I thought it would be just a little bit more -- I don't know, I just -- when I think of Arizona, I think of like, coyotes and cactus and desert, and hot air, not having water. And I definitely do not think or see -- think of what I'm seeing. There you go.I definitely do not think or see -- I'm sorry I'm all like thrown together right now. My thoughts -- this was just kind of a spur of a moment thing.So yeah, basically I'm in Arizona on a business trip. It's been really, really cool, seeing everything. This city is huge. Like, it's massive. I thought Modesto was a big city. Boy, was I wrong. This -- ceeway -- city and freeway together, ceeway.Oh, another thing. I have shirts coming out on District lines, pretty exciting. Um, I'm working with designs right now. I really hope you guys are gonna like them, because they're -- it's a little bit different, probably, than my last design, and it'll --it's for -- it's good for both, um, sexes, because there were some people that complained a little bit. They said that their shirts were too girly. And I'm -- I was trying to think, like, how can I make a strawberry shirt that isn't girly?Someone's calling me. I won't answer it, but uh.I don't know, how do you make a strawberry manly? I think -- when I think of strawberry, I think of -- I don't know, I don't know. I'm not gonna -- I'm not gonna say anything about that.But uh, future videos, I guess, just to say: there's the question answer one, there is a vlog in a you choose. I think you guys like that, when I give you guys the option of what my next video will be. And based off of that video, you'll see the result -- resulting video. And then I have a skit with me and my brother. That's gonna be really, really funny. Just me and David, because, uh, Christian moved to Sacramento.That's, uh, Burry family news for you guys. He's, uh, left the nest. Definitely didn't think he would be the first one to leave. I thought at least I would be the first one out of the house, but he's gone. We miss him. So um, that's about it.So yeah, I'm starting college, I'm in Arizona right now. Um, there will be more -- more videos in October. Oh, and I want to know, what are you guys gonna be for Halloween? I'm just -- I'm trying to figure out my costume, and in the blog TV, I said I was going to be Hermione Granger, but I'm maybe going to Disneyland for Halloween and I think -- I don't know. I want to be a Disney character, sorta. But I don't know what I would be or who I would be. So, I wanna know what you guys are gonna be and then, um, if you guys have any suggestions for who I should be, just go ahead and leave it in the comments, because I am just -- I just don't know. I don't know, and I don't want to look retarded either, so -- which -- yeah, anyways. So um, I'll see you guys later 'cause this is getting kind of long and I'll edit it up. Um, yes. Bye.","High","Low","High"
"VLOG419","Bypathway House is for children when they reach six to eighteen so that they learn the skills they need to become a functioning member of society. We give these children a chance to be adults. So kids who come from Russia, but Russia is part of the USSR and part of communism and part of the Soviet Union, and so these statistics are through the entire area.On the first of January, two thousand and three, there were as many as eight hundred sixty seven thousand and eight hundred orphans in Russia alone. Only ten percent of the orphans are the result of the death of their parents. The other ninety percent are social orphans. Their parents simply abandoned them.About fifteen thousand children leave Russian orphanages each year once they are eighteen years old. Of these five thousand are employed, six thousand are homeless, around three thousand resort to crime, and approximately fifteen hundred commit suicide. Roughly half the girls end up in prostitution. There is a video of the Chernobyl Children's Project International has done, which would be right here, so click on that for more information. It shows what they do and it explains how they go about .The test of the morality of a society is what it does for its children -- Dietrich Bonhoeffer.In nineteen ninety one, the Soviet Union ended, which meant that a whole bunch of countries had to figure out how to be a government on their own. Seventeen years later, those countries are still struggling. There's a lot of things that need to happen for these countries to be as efficient and as good as they can be, and there's a lot of these things that will take a lot of time for it to happen. And it's not something you can throw money at and it's not something that you can go in and fix in one day. There needs to be a full renovation of the government, which people are resistant to.This charity especially focuses on disabled children, because they're the most neglected in former Soviet countries. Often, if a child is disabled, simply even being blind or deaf, they'll be put into a mental institution. The country's children are suffering because of it. The charity I want to support and mention is called the Chernobyl Children's Project International and it's for countries that were affected by the Chernobyl disaster in nineteen eighty six. Because of Chernobyl, a lot of radiation was put into that area, which caused a lot of birth defects in children and a lot of problems for the people that live there. These places do not provide therapy. These places provide a meal and a bed. Many of the children in these institutions are unable to speak because no one has taught them to speak. No one talks to these children.Chernobyl Children's Project International goes in.","Low","Low","High"

"VLOG420","Hi guys, I thought I would make this video using this camera today seeing as I can't be bothered to turn on my laptop. But I thought I'd get cracking on the whole Lee Evans video because I know one of my subscribers wanted me to make it. So I'm going to talk about Lee Evans and Michael Macintyre.Well, you're probably going to find it weird but I've never really heard of Lee Evans before my subscriber actually mentioned it to me, I was like who the hell is he? She was like, he's a comedian. I've seen him on TV and been at my friend's house, because she's got a video of him, like, you know, videos and I've been watching him and he's really funny. I mean obviously, he's a comedian. Yes, I didn't realize he's was that funny. I think he's good, I think he's a good comedian, yes, cool.He really sweats a lot, a big turn off. I don't know why he sweats that much. My personal favorite comedian, Michael Macintyre, who I think is brilliant, I think he's amazing, I love -- he's a funny guy. I think he's really funny as well as Lee Evans because they're comedians really, I don't know. But Michael Macintyre's my personal favorite. I think Lee Evans is very good comedian as well though. Is it just me or does anyone else think the same.I don't know if you've seen the East Indian's theme like, when it kind of does a circle bit around London, like EOT , does like a circle bit and then the titles come up. Have you noticed that they've actually changed the blinking - the whole sequence. I don't like it. It like comes up through the clouds. It's really crap. It looks so fake. Some of you might think it looks really good. You know, it's nice and colorful, but I think it is fake, well it is fake. It just looks so crap.Do you know those adverts that you get that are like, about the whole text love and your partner -- see how long the relationship lasts? They've got this advert where this girl, she's like sitting, crying outside the church with her wedding dress on, going . That was so bad, sorry. She was just -and it said, she didn't listen - she texted her partner's name and her name to eight hundred or whatever and the love match was crapped or something. She didn't listen and carried on with her relationship as if everything was normal and fine which she obviously thought it was. But then at the end of the relationship, on her wedding day, he left her. I mean, as if that's going to happen in real life. I hate when they do this, grab your money, oh my, that relationship is not going to last. If you want to find out what relationship lasts longer, subscribe to us for three euro a week for the rest of your life, so we can take all of your money.I'm starting college on -- this Monday, so yeah. I'm really looking forward to the weekend. They've got the tent festival in London and Diversity are going to be there, free as well. Wow, free. So I'm going to that. I didn't even plan what I was going to do this weekend, but I just heard about it a couple of days ago so I thought, yes, I'm going to that.You know that new movie, Street Dance? The one who , well they're looking for extras, so I applied and I'm going to go there on the nineteenth to do whatever, be one of the crowd or something. I'm looking forward -- I'm pumped up for that.I would like to say thank you to my subscribers for subscribing to me and any time in the near future that you subscribe to me, thank you. You know, I have seventy subscribers at the moment which is a very good success for me, because I've never really got that far on Youtube, which is brilliant.

"VLOG421","Hi. Yeah, I keep cranking them out don't I? Uh huh. Okay, where was I? Yes. Maybelline lipsticks. These are the plumping kind, the plumping excel or whatever the devil that they call them but they're not going to be around anymore so I grabbed all I could see. They were like three something a piece whatever. This particular color I'm showing you is number one forty. Petal Attraction. They don't even swatch, so, yeah, they have that rough edge to them still. This one is six forty, Caramelizing Coffee and they're in no particular order, smells good though. seven twenty, Sultry Sienna. I did try one however and it was tingly, definitely seemed tingly. This is one eighty, Airy Desirable. This guy here is three twenty, Passionate Plum. That's pretty, that's gonna look really good on even if it's sheers 'cause I don't know what's going on. Five twenty, Crimson Crush. I'm probably going to run out of time, so if cuts off, it just cut off, and I have to come back but I'll go until it stops. This guy here six twenty in the nude. That gonna look good too. two twenty, Mische -- Mischievous Mall. One more. I thought there was like ten of them but there's like nine colors. This is Peach Plump, number one twenty. So, yeah. Getting down to the wire now, I found -- I got an absolute pencil and Blue Nile so this one's part of my absolute collection of pencils, I'll finally get the rest of those at one point. And, make up remover that I got for after Halloween and fancy maker's white polish, after Halloween of course. Show all of that. These are two LA colors. Face powders, one of them I have in natural, the other one I have in dark. 'cause I'm gonna take this -- some of it anyway -- and mix it with other things and see whether or not I can make different shades with it. Jordana is also getting rid of certain things as far as lip pencils and so on is concerned, so this is a hot pepper, natural, sweet plum, rich chocolate.","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG422","This is going to be a spot the Ken video, so link's down there.Okay um, you know how I promised you a response, and I thought I had a good idea? But then I started thinking and I realized, um well, it's not completely out of relevance, but it's not as relevant as I thought it would be.Anyway, your video was about celebrities, and how we mis imagine them, um, which I think a lot of people do. They just -- they just, oh my gosh, they're so hot or they're so sexy, and stuff like that. But I think that there are people out there that kind of, I -- idolize them, or look up to them, for some pretty good reasons, and -- and, I think that at certain celebrities would be fitting for the term of a role model. For example, the examples that you gave about acting.Um, it does take certain work to get there. I mean, you have to be a good actor to start with, so you kinda have to practice. You gotta join groups and lessons and stuff like that, and you got to work on your own skills.But then, you also gotta get out there. Like, no one's gonna notice you -- very rarely anyone's going to notice you by chance, so you really have to go there, you have to go through auditions, you gotta put yourself out there, and that takes a lot of work and a lot of people aren't really willing to do that.You know, that whole side of acting and -- and, being in movies, and stuff like that, somebody brought up, and so -- and so celebrities kind of sometimes get a bad rap about -- or they just have a scene in one movie, plus it might have taken a lot of work to be able to get into that movie, and making that movie might have also taken a lot of work. So, most of all, I think, kind of, don't realize that. Most of celebrities also don't expect to be that famous.I was watching an interview about the Harry Potter thing, and the actors, that they said that they did not expect Harry Potter to be that big of a hit, and I myself, back when the first movie came out, I didn't expect that -- it to be that much of a hit. So granted that was before I became a fan of Harry Potter. I bet it turned out to be really successful, and no one really expected that.So it's not like they thrusted it upon themselves, it was -- it was pretty much -- everyone else was, pretty much, putting it on them. They all watched it, they all loved it, and then it all kind of ties in with I -- I've always been thinking about, how celebrities make so much more money than doctors, and stuff like that.You -- you know, you mentioned how they don't really contribute anything good, whereas doctors and people like that, they do. Well, it's -- I think it's where their money comes from. I mean, in terms of being a doctor's -- in Canada, it comes from the government, I think, and in America, it comes from the actual sick patients. Whereas celebrities, their money is coming from anyone who just watches a movie. Basically, if you go and see that movie, you're contributing to their money, and, you know, tying up with what I said before, about not asking to be popular, if it suddenly does get popular, then they make lots of money. I mean, it's just fair right, that they get their fair share of all the profits.And I guess the thing with idolizing celebrities is that um, they're an example of where you can go the, but that's if all -- what I just said, like, working hard kind of pays off. Because I think that generally accepted thing about using the arts as a career is that, it's kind of very hard to get into. I mean, yeah, you can do what you like, it's not as hard as, maybe, the sciences, but it's really hard to get into. And, you know, there are a lots of actors that have to move far away from home to Hollywood, and all of that, just so they can, kinda hopefully break out, and many don't, so that's kind of that fear, I guess.So in esteem, the celebrities, and their success, kind of inspires them as well -- it's just my thinking. But don't get the idea that I'm completely disagreeing with you. In fact, I think I kind of agree with ev -- everything you said.Um, although it's good to kind of have a role model, and it would be pretty great to meet them, standing in line just to get a look, in real life of someone you idolize, maybe not really necessary. Then again, once again, I have no right to say what people can or can't do, you know? I -- I have a lot of things that I'm sure that a lot of people would disagree with as well, but -- hmm. And also, some people kind of go way off in terms of idolizing them. I was watching the Woods show once, where some girl said that Paris Hilton was the perfect role model. I don't know where in that child's life that came from, but I think something might be wrong there.Since, to summarize it, I agree with you on points in your video, and I also hope I could have add -- added something to your thought about celebrities. And, just one more thing. Um, you were the one that sent me the email regarding the -- you know -- right? 'Cause, I've never done it before, I'm still kind of freaked out. Sorry if I'm bugging you about it.Bye.","Low","Low","High"

"VLOG424","Hey, internet. It's Wednesday, December second two thousand and nine and man it's not a good day for the gays, no parades today. That's because the New York Senate smacked down the legalization of gay marriage with a thirty eight to twenty four vote. And this vote, among many things, makes me realize we're just waiting for the old and ignorant to die like Strom Thurmond, God bless his racist motherfucking soul because when a representative in Washington is also the same guy that filibustered four segregations, you just have to wonder, when are you going to die?And I know gays are scary to lots of people. All fire and brimstone and assless chaps. The gays are awesome. If not for the gays, we wouldn't have the Village People, the Bravo Network, sodomy. And sodomy is so popular with everyone, even the Catholic Church picked it up but with their own little twist on it.If you're Catholic and offended by that, shut up, I was raised as Catholic. From the age of two we're told feel guilty about everything. My mother would always quote, I would rather you see the good womb of a whore than on the ground. Where the hell is that?And there are three reasons I had to leave the Catholic religion. One, Catholicism is anti masturbation. Two, can't masturbate, but you're also not allowed to use birth control. And three, they don't believe dogs go to heaven. That's a lie. That shit was even in a movie.But it's funny that we're actually talking about the Catholic Church because the Catholic Church is in the news because of a new PETA ad. Oh, my God my two favorite things. The new ad involves Joanna Crupper . Don't know who she is, doesn't matter because Joanne is completely naked with a cross in a church surrounded by puppies, not even joking. I can't show you the full picture, not even because I would be flagged. So much blood would instantly leave your brain to go elsewhere, you would die, and I don't need that on my chest.Not surprisingly the church has a problem with this, seeing that PETA has a history of exploiting Jewish and Catholic themes. Joanna Crupper responded that she was shocked that the Catholic Church was against her ads and she's doing God's work by defending the defenseless animals. I'd have to side with PETA on this one, mainly because I like naked girls and masturbation. Two things Catholicism has shown me that they are not big fans of.But back to the gays. For some reason they just scare people even in the new video game, Dragon Edge there's a scene where your character can engage another guy. If you select the right options you can have gay sex and there's this is weird steamy cut scene and not surprisingly, someone's going to have a problem with it. Not only are those video games making our kids violent, they're turning them into homosexuals. But the next generation of children will be, like, motherfucker, I said floor print motherfucker; I'm a pop your ass. Seriously there are a ton of websites on the internet that believe there is a conspiracy to turn the children gay. What motive, I don't know. We'll turn everyone gay then they'll realize no one can get married and then that's when they'll legalize gay marriage, it's all part of our evil gay plan.Now where's my body gooder, I have to go and do some young sexual boys and turn them gay. If we're being completely honest, marriage isn't the holiest of holies anymore. I mean, the only difference between marriage back then and marriage now is the progression of woman's rapes and the invention of the prenup. That's why there are so many divorces these days. There's no reason to stay in a loveless marriage.And that makes me want to go back to Tiger Woods. He's been getting drugged through the mud this week, the voice mail audio is released to the internet of Tiger Woods telling his mistress to change her information because his wife may call. And Tiger Woods apologized to everyone on his website. As of today, a third woman has come to light to say she had an affair with Tiger Woods. Her name? Don't know. Let's call her vagina number three. I'm wondering when are these woman going to stop coming out? How many holes did Tiger play?But the main question of this video is shouldn't gay people have the rights and the chance to live in a loveless marriage, to have and to hold, to resent and regret for as long as they shall live? I think so.But guys that's just my opinion and I know I'll be inviting a lot of heat in with this question. But what's your stance on New York slapping down on legalization of gay marriage? It's the question of the day. Guys, that's all that matters to me this Wednesday.My name's XXXX and you've just been filled in.","High","High","High"
"VLOG425","﻿Ah, good lighting. So background change, guess what that means? I've moved. Yeah, and my room sounds really echo ey. I haven't really talked in it before, so, yeah.But, hey, um, I got home from Ansi on Friday to find out that they had moved my moving day to Saturday instead of today, so I've basically packed everything and I pretty much got everything. I forgot some things, but that's okay; they can give it to me. My old host parents are just, you know, like, ten, fifteen minutes away so.But anyway, so I have no internet in my room which is a sad fact, but I think that it's better because that means that I have to be downstairs when I want to use the computer. But they do have Wi Fi. I almost said weefee again, that's how they call it, weefee, new pronunciation. Beyond moving to my new to host family, also, um, with the XXXX we had to do a change of people which meant a change of days so now I'm Mondays. So if you go to the YouTube channel XXXX tomorrow at some point, after school for me, there will be a video up of me. Yeah, XXXX, and links in the sidebar.I'm going to give a shout out now to basically all of my friends who were completely awesome and sent me Christmas cards and presents and stuff. Like seriously, I came home from Ansi and I had two packages and three letters on my bed. That made my day, like completely and it was like -- Ray, you're amazing. I loved my presents. I used this all the time and there were like, seven other things, oh yeah, like this friendship bracelet, yay! But yeah, she gave me like eight things as a kind of a Hanuka ey things.XXXX, thank you for the card; you made me happy. XXXX, I love you. And another thing when I got here last night, there was already a package. I bought some books on Amazon and it said that one of the books was going to come on the sixth, well it came earlier like, on the second or something. So maybe that means that my other books won't come on the twenty sixth -- they'll come like on the twentieth which would be awesome.But so now I have Inkdeath and I'm so excited. This, like the series is so good and the movie is coming out this month. I found out that it has been translated into French and it's coming out on the twenty eighth. So that means that day isn't going to be depressing for me; it's going to be awesome. I'm not going to explain that depressing part.I already started reading it and I really wish that I had the first two books but they have a synopsis of the first two books in the front of the book which is really cool which, and it really helped.Last night my host brothers and their older brother, who is normally in Paris, had a whole bunch of friends over and we played Rock Band for like, two hours and I sang and played bass and it was really fun, so I'm happy.Well, I have to go back to unpacking now, so I will see you guys on -- I'll see you guys tomorrow on Nerd Finderly Girls and on Wednesday here.I think I may go to a once a week with this one just because. I don't know, maybe we'll see.Tell me what you think down there. Bye.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG426","Hi everyone. Um, a lot has happened in the last week, so I'm just gonna tell you what all I've done and I have a book to talk about, so let's get going.Okay. So over the past week I got a book called Dream Boy and, um, I really didn't think it was gonna to be super good, I just thought it was something to do. It's, ah, only, like, two hundred pages -- a hundred ninety five or something like that and, um, it took me two days to read and I -- like I usually don't read books fast and I don't read books at all if I don't like them that much and this was really, really good. Like, um, the summary of it I would say is like this kid has an abusive relationship with his father and, you know, he's gay, so he finds a guy and all this other stuff happens and then the ending is like really deep, and if you can understand the meaning of it it's like -- it's a big deal. I don't know. I really liked it. So if you've ever read Dream Boy or seen the movie then just like, leave a comment below. I've never seen the movie, so I -- I want to see it, but I've never seen it. I don't know if it's like appropriate or not, but anyways -- yeah. So, there's my rant on the book.Also, I've realized lately like there's a couple of people that I really want to catch up with, but I kind of, like, am afraid to, and I don't know why. Like there's no reason that I'm afraid to, I just. Like, have you ever felt that way where you can talk to someone, that you like really enjoy being friends with for so long and then you want to talk to them, but you can't or you don't, for some reason and it's just really weird because there's this guy and like, I've never actually been in a relationship with him of any kind other than just like, not even really friends, just acquaintances that we talk -- like we -- I guess we're friends, we talk every now and then. And then he moved to a new town which, you know, he lived on the other side of Ohio and now he lives like up north in Indiana, so it's the same distance away. I guess it doesn't even matter 'cause I probably won't ever see him, anyways, but I want to know what is going on in his life and all that other -- all that kind of stuff and it's just weird because like, I don't even know him that well, but for some reason I still, like, care about him. I -- I don't even know why, it's just like -- have you ever felt that way where you just care about someone, but you don't know why. And -- so I just want to catch up with him and I don't even really know him. It's just really weird, it's really weird.Also, if you haven't heard Adam Lambert's like, new CD like all of it, you need to go check it out because I have never been so obsessed with a CD, other than Lady Gaga because she's just, you know, she's Lady Gaga. But other than Lady Gaga, I've never liked an album as much as Adam Lambert's new album and it's just so good. Like, it has so many good songs on it. I think my favorite is If I had you or Pick You Up, because those are really up beat and I don't know, they're fun to walk too, 'cause I walk to my friends like, every day and I don't know they're really fun.All right, I think I'm done rambling about all these different things for now. Um, I'm going to leave with a question which is, um, it's do you believe in God or whatever, the universe or whatever. If you had a choice to die or to go to heaven right now, or stay alive and experience the rest of your life, what would you do?All right, thanks for watching, guys. Um, follow me on Twitter and Tumbler and all that stuff. So, .Um, thanks for watching, thanks for subscribing, thanks for reading and all that other stuff that you guys do so well and thank you, and thank you and thank you to a Gay Day for letting me fill in for them and getting me so many subscribers. Um, yeah. I'm going to head on and work on the homework again. Night guys, bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG427","Hi, um, so the other day my brother IM'd me, and he's like, 'your videos are , and I was like, 'what do you mean ? ' And so anyway, I'll -- , means your, -- um, mini Japanese lesson -- um, means, embarrassing. So, I was like, what do you mean it's embarrassing, Scott? And he's like, oh no, no, no, I don't mean that you -- you embarrass me or anything, but I would never post something like that of myself'. So, I was like whatever, dude, um, I'm not embarrassed.And, ah, Cindy my, ah, co worker, friend, so I told her about the blog and she, she checked them out and today she told me that, um, I like, flirt with the camera. She's like, you're not like that in real life, I was like, um, well you don't -- you know, like, people have different dimensions to their personality. And she's like yeah, true, but then when do I get to see that dimension of you? So, I don't know, like, I thought about it, um, and I guess maybe it does seem like I'm flirting with the camera, because it's such an intimate setting. Like, it's like me, and the camera, and romantic music playing in the background, so yeah, maybe. Like, I don't try to flirt; I don't think I'm flirting right now.Um, anyway, so this song is, um, my favorite, like, Hawaiian rendition, um, of -- this one is, um, Tracy Chapman's Baby Can I Hold You Tonight, by Aleya . I think it's really nice, it reminds me of, like, summer, the first time, the years I lived in Hawaii, how much I loved it.Um, so anyway, um, today I went to Wholefoods and I bought some ingredients, because I'm going to make, um, spicy sausage, eggplant, arrabbiata pasta. So, like normally, like, I usually make um, -- whenever I make pasta I always make arrabbiata, because that's the only thing I can make that tastes good. So, last time I made it, I, um, made my own noodles, so. I got -- I get really into things like that. So I made my own noodles from flour, and scratch, and then, I like, you know, cut strips -- we're using a pizza roller, but they turned out really irregular.So I, um, went to cooking. com and ordered a pasta maker, but um, I haven't used it; I ordered it, like, four months ago. Which reminds me, that I share the same character trait as my father, where like, you know, we get really into our interests and go all out and then suddenly, like, you know, we're not interested in it anymore.So, I remember a couple of years ago, my dad bought, ah, a pasta maker, too. But Papa, you never used that thing, I've never seen you use it, so ah, yeah. And also -- oh yeah -- my father, ah, sent me a message saying, you know, that I shouldn't quit my day job, but he liked my videos, unlike my brother. And, he, he suggested that him and I do one some time in the future. So, I would like to do that, and also make pasta together. But it's kind of hard because he lives in Japan and I live in San Francisco, also, but maybe next time we see each other, we can make homemade pasta, and do videos.Okay, bye bye.","High","High","Low"

"VLOG43","﻿Hey guys, so I went shopping the other day and because I wanted to avoid all those horrible things that happen to people who pay with cash on those debit card commercials, I, of course, used my debit card. But you know I realized that with all the things you have to input after you swipe your card, perhaps cash is faster after all.Your total is twenty three seventy four.All right, um, I'm just gonna do debit so I'll just, um, swipe.*beep beepOh, right, PIN number.*beepUh, no cash back.*beepOkay, that is correct.*beepMy sister?*beepI don't see how that really applies.*beepWhat?But seriously, though, sometimes it's like playing twenty questions with those things and not only that, but um, usually when you swipe your card, you swipe it at the wrong time and then the cashier looks at you like you're a dumbass for trying to pay for your shit. Um, anyway though, uh if you read my blog you'll know that I've been working on a little EP and I've decided to release it November twenty third, uh, the XXXX EP. Obviously two songs that I've already done are on it, uh, XXXX in XXXX which I've made music videos to, and plus a remix of XXXX and three other songs that I've worked really hard on and am proud of.So to make things a little more interesting I thought I would hold a little contest leading up to it on November twenty third. So all you have to do is you follow me on Twitter -- my Twitter is just twitter dot com slash XXXX and I will be giving out XXXX from my last video -- I have a ton of them. So I'll Twitter something like, the eleventh person to reply to this Twitter about my EP will uh, win a paper crane, and then if you're the eleventh person, I'll send you a direct message and get that sent on to you. So the link to my Twitter will be in the description and also a link where you can find more information about the EP.I'll be making a music video to one of my favorite songs that I made on the album called XXXX and that'll be out sometime soon. You'll also be able to download the EP on, like, iTunes, Rhapsody, all of those music download sites and hopefully I'll also have a physical copy that you can actually buy. I'm also planning a few other special things for it coming out, but more about that later.Um, that's it for now, so bye guys!","High","High","High"

Um, I'll look it up on Wikipedia later, or you can. Um, I'll-- yeah, I'll put the link on the sidebar; that way I think it is, yeah, pretty sure, it's that way.

"VLOG432","﻿Hello. I know that this is really close and I know that my skin is the same color as the white closet door behind me but, you know, that's just how is it, um, on a good day so, let's just get started.Band is pretty much taking up all of my time. There's really nothing I can do about it. And I promise that I will post more videos and get more involved in the -- once band's over which is going to be November first. It's the first day that I won't have any band things to do in the future. It's kind of weird thinking about it because band has been such a big part of my life for the past four -- three years and, well, this one too, but -- I had my last first competition on Saturday and it didn't really go as planned. We didn't march because the field was really muddy so it was -- it was kind of hard to get all sentimental about it, but it was nice.Um, it's really weird just thinking about growing up. And I'm not necessarily one of the people who want to grow up. I don't think that growing up is a good thing necessarily. I don't think that my life is going to magically get better once I am grown up. Besides, what does grown up mean anyway?Um, so I finished the Hunger and Catching Fire and I have to say, they're the most beautiful, most intense books that I have ever read apart from Harry Potter and they are definitely on my favorites list. And right now I'm trying to finish off The Catcher in the Rye and Harry Potter's Should've Died, by the lovely mugglenut. com and, um, I'm reading Grindle for school and I really want to read a Sigmund Freud biography so if you know of any super good ones then I would love for you to tell me which one I should read. And, um, I've got to read the Iliad and the Odyssey.I'm not really sure if I like this really zero close up thing but I wasn't really liking the really far away thing either. I'm seriously thinking about getting my hair cut really short, like I think it would be adorable and I really kind of want to. And I don't really have anything else to say, but fall break is next week and I'm really not all that excited because it just means that I have to do my college applications because I've been putting them off. And, um, I'm applying to Vanderbilt which is in Tennessee which is where I live and I'm really nervous about it because I kind of don't think I'll get in. I -- I would love to go there but it would be a lot easier just to go to my local college. And just it would be a lot cheaper and I would be around friends but would it be as good of an education? No it wouldn't, but I'm not really sure if sixty thousand dollars of debt is gonna be worth it all. I don't know. I'm just thinking.Anyways, I've got a lot of homework to do, a lot I've procrastinated on by making like ten versions of this video but I'm going to need to finally just stop making different versions and host this one. So I'm going to go and I promise once band's over, I will become more involved in YouTube and I promise that maybe one day, I'll actually smile on a video. I know I've been kind of detached and like emotionless, at least my expression. So that's that and I'll see you guys later. Okay, bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG433","Hello there. There is a slim chance you are watching this video because you saw it featured on one of my channels or maybe you're subscribed and you saw it in your subscriptions. There is a very slim chance that you just stumbled on it. Or maybe you found it in a related search or in someone's favorites.But most likely you are watching this video because it was sent to you as an attachment and a personal message on YouTube. Ahh! Some of you may be angry about that; some of you may even call me a spammer. When I put up a video, I typically share it out once, and then I let it go its own way. I don't put pressure on people to watch my videos.If you felt pressure to watch this video because I sent it to you in a personal message, that was not my intention. I put up videos for people to see whenever they have the time to. They're not going anywhere. Because of the number of contacts I have, for me to get to all of their videos would be impossible, so I can't expect everyone to come see mine. They're there for whenever someone wants to come and watch them.I didn't gain five thousand subscribers on my main channel by just putting up my videos and letting them go either. I do share them out once, and I think that is reasonable.There are three types of people on YouTube.﻿Overall this is a video sharing website. That is what YouTube is all about. If you don't like receiving videos at all from people, then you should get off of YouTube, go to Myspace, go to Facebook. Those sites are centered around messages and comments and blogs. It's not centered around videos. Now I don't know about Facebook but I know that at Myspace you cannot load videos which you can embed, and you can send out emails to your friends or your family. It's not centered around videos so you won't be getting them all the time. I suggest you go over there.Having my inbox so full all the time with all the stuff, it's very hard for me to get my important messages.There is a simple solution to that. Stop using YouTube as your personal messaging centre. Exchange email addresses. Exchange instant messengers with the people that you would be receiving these important messages from. The other thing to do if you just must be on YouTube but you don't want videos, is put your channel on friend lock. Go into your accounts settings, lock your channels so only friends can message you, and then when you get friend invites, do not accept them. Just ignore them. Some people here think that the label friend on YouTube means friend like good buddy, pal. If you want to make it that you can, nobody's gonna stop you. But that's not YouTube's intention of that label, friend. When you get a friend invite, you get a notification that says, friend invitation. So and so would like to share videos with you. It doesn't say that so and so wants to get to know you personally and establish a one on one emotional connection with you. When you get one of these friend invites, you just might think to yourself, well so and so is sending this invitation just because they want to send me videos. Well, yeah. Once again this is YouTube, it's a video sharing site. The whole idea is to send a friend invite to exchange videos with, to see if you like the videos that they're sending you, to see if they like the videos you send them and maybe if you like them that much you might subscribe to each other. Here's a little clue. If you don't like their videos you don't have to subscribe. But if you have friend lock on your channel and you don't want them sending videos to you any more -- it's a secret. All you do is remove them as a friend.And then they can't send you videos any more. It's as simple as that. And that's all I have to say. And you know that if, uh, this video was sent to you and I hope that it didn't bother you too much. But in case it did, well you know what to do about it.Thanks for your time, and keep trying out your videos.﻿It's related to your videos; but it is not spam. Now, just because doing this is not spam, doesn't mean that it can't be abused. Every single day, my inbox is flooded with hundreds of personal messages with videos attached to them. Some people send me the same video three times a day. Some people will send me a few different videos every single day. Some people will send me one video every single day. But, I don't say anything to them. I accept it, because I'm a video watcher and a video maker. And I'm serious about the videos I make. I want people to watch my videos. So, by me allowing people to send their videos to me, I expect that they can't get mad at me for sending them videos. I don't send many personal messages. You might get one from me, I don't know, once every other week, maybe. If that, maybe a whole month will go by and you won't even get anything from me with the exception of this time, because you know I just couldn't resist but to send this message out through a personal message. So, I get my inbox flooded with all this stuff. I try to send one message to people and I get a lot of heat from it and that's crap. I put up with all this; I try to send out one video. I got people calling me a spammer. Doing this reasonably is not spam and don't let anybody ever tell you other--.","High","High","High"
"VLOG434","Posing as a Palestinian born Muslim suffering from Israeli oppression. Interestingly enough, he was later exposed as a Christian, born in Cairo, so what he was up to I still don't know. Here comes the full circle. Edward Saed has a very good friend. He wrote a forward for a book that dis -- he described as very much necessary reading. The book is titled Fugitive Days, and the author -- you'll never guess -- yup, if you recognize this thug, it is William Ayers, who has pretty much faded from spotlight, but I think we should bring him back, because Obama continually plays him down. But as we see, there is much more to Ayers than most people even realize. In fact, I'd probably pose more questions than answers. But the way I see it, is on some very powerful people with some very dangerous motives, have groomed, and launched Obama into the spotlight. He has deep Muslim ties, and the fact that he accomplished nothing, other than run for president, should make every American stop --- The capital and other buildings. He's never apologized.But thi - this is an example of what I'm talking about. Uh, this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who's a professor of English in Chicago. Uh, who I know and who I have not, uh, received some official endorsement from. He's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis.Oh, I'm such a shit.I figured this was a shut case; someone was smearing Obama, and that was it. But, not so fast. The Sutton family, actually contacted by newsnet. com surprisingly said that Kevin Wardally is not a spokesman for the family, but actually a player in Harlem politics and someone challenging Sutton for the position. They denied any links to Wardally, who did not even get Sutton's age right. Apparently Sutton was actually 88, not 86.So what about Obama's campaign officially denying Obama knowing Al Mansour? Well, get this; Al Mansour himself admitted he knew Obama, further saying in an interview with newsnet. com, again -- involved in any way in celebrity sweepstakes. I wish him well. Anything I can do, if he'll let me know, I'll let him know what I think I can do or can't. But I don't collect autographs. I wish him the best, and hope he can win the election.Nineteen eighties, Al Mansour gave lectures at -- including in places like Columbia University. I suspect they met there. But who is Al Mansour, and why should we even care? Jeremiah Wright, move over. You ain't got nothin' on this guy. Check out the impressive resume. Well known in the black community as a lawyer, an orthodox Muslim, a Black Nationalist -- he mentored Huey Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party -- an educator, politically outspoken hater of Israel -- all the Jews who support Obama, pay attention -- and an author, with works that include, I quote, The Lost Books of Africa Rediscovered, where he illustrates how United States was planning to perform genocide against black Americans; The Destruction of Western Civilization as Seen Through Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, and Americans, Beware: The Zionist Plot Against Saudi Arabia. It still doesn't make any sense.What is Al Mansour, one of the most connected, well known, black Muslims in the world, have to do with Obama? Well actually, he does. Jack Cashill from WorldNetDaily wrote an article by the name of  Candidates.  Interesting title, I must admit. And Al Mansour has a friend, or used to have a friend, named Edward Said, an author and apparently somewhat of a terrorist sympathizer due to his very left like leanings. Well Al Mansour and Said have connections to the publishing world. In Columbia, Obama attended some of his lectures where they became friends apparently, because there is a photograph floating around of a 1998 Arab American dinner -","Low","Low","Low"

Like this.And that meant I'm trying to write something in Norwegian but the voice reads this in English and it was supposed to say, . What's the difference?It's not the same law. And second, I want to apologize for my late video updates but I didn't have my computer this summer and my camera, I thought it was broken but I figured out I could film with it anyway so, um, hopefully I'll be making How to be Norwegian Lesson Two, very soon so stay tuned. Stay strong and stay tuned so, um, yup, goodbye.This is the end of the video. Goodbye.","High","High","High"
"VLOG436","﻿What's up, XXXX? Don't you know, my name's XXXX. What's up, man? So I'm getting back to you today on, uh, your vlog. The one where you had mentioned about people, you know us, the XXXX and you, doing a weight loss deal for September and you know, I'm throwing my two cents. I'm down to do that with you guys and uh, if you want to lose weight and you need some inspiration, I'll be here for you, man. Just, uh, as long as you're my inspiration. You know, we could work together and just bust tail. Bust tail . This past year, I've been trying to lose weight, and I -- I've succeeded pretty well. I've lost seventy one pounds total -- you know, in total. Uh, but I gained twenty pounds back in the past two, three months which is a bummer, because I busted, you know, I busted my -- my butt to do that and to get that far.So I need to get back on the bandwagon and do this, so if you're going to do it, I'm down and I will support you one hundred percent. And it's funny, 'cause you were talking about, uh, you know XXXX, who looked like a Marine. Basically that's what I'm trying to lose weight for, because I want to join the Marine Corps. And, uh, I've already passed one of my deadlines which is a bummer too 'cause I coulda been in boot camp already in San Diego, California, close to you guys. Should've been cool too, because after boot camp I could've got to meet . I don't know. And anyway, I need to get back in shape and do that, 'cause I was doing well and I just need to get back on the bandwagon so -- I'm going to be here doing this if you are so -- yeah, let's do it. Let's do it, mijo. You're my mijo. I'm your mijo. We're at manos . Let's do it. I'm serious.","High","Low","High"

It happens unless they're on Facebook, I don't know their name pretty much and so -- but people know my name so they'll come up to me and, like, hey Tara and I'll be like hey you, yeah you.

We're doing this young bonfire at night so it's like sit around the campfire, eat as much desert as you can, roast some marshmallows and a few of us are gonna be sharing like, why we are still Christian and what it means for us and how we actually got to be Christians in the first place.

"VLOG44","﻿So this is a quick video response to YouTubers exposed by XXXX. Regardless of this video in the negative things he has said about me in live shows, Mr. XXXX is probably one of the funniest fucking people on YouTube. Realist, I'm not going to say that, no -- um, but funniest yes. And his ability to handle the internet audience is something to be admired, because mother fucker, oh my God, do a lot of people believe the bullshit coming out of your mouth.And you know, a lot of it is true, a lot of it is true; but when you are talking about people using -- everyone that uses question of the day, post on a regular basis; saying that makes them sane. That makes no sense; posting on a regular basis has existed ever since there was fucking media. If newspapers came out randomly, I wouldn't know what the fuck was going on. I know that in the morning I can go up to the newsstand, holy shit there's a newspaper; right on time. I guess that makes me stupid that I got a scheduling shit that when I turn on the radio, I go, oh shit, the MJ morning show is on. That shit is not randomly popping up, it's seven PM.And the question of the day is misused by many a person, because they see people using it and they're like holy shit that works. I didn't invent the question of the day, it was invented by the first person whoever had an opinion, who wanted to know other people's opinions. And it has been bastardized on YouTube, you make a video, it's like, do you like turkey? Check yes or no in the comments below, because it helps my video. That rhymes, yay.And there's a lot of shit that goes down on YouTube that pisses me off, but you realize that it's part of the game and you've just got to deal with it or eventually those people will fuck up. There are a lot of people who gained an audience doing bad shit. There were people spamming; people with messages like hey remember me, subscribe to me; or like back in the days when people fluffed their views like SMP films, using a video reloader. It wasn't him it was a friend doing it.Another thing that got me was when XXXX said, you know all these fake mother fuckers, but YouTube needs to feature people like Charles Trippy and Timothy. Okay, I love those guys, but if I don't see a video that they posted with some sexy thumb nail title of Hot Chick Does Blobbedy, Bla, Bla, Bla, I am shocked and they are playing the game just like anybody else.The summary of this video is yes, it does annoy me with the shit that goes on with YouTube. Is it everyone? No, but yes it does annoy me when people cheat or at least in my eyes cheat. Like a child that gets their videos audio spotlighted, because there's a dude that works for YouTube that has invested in that company. The way I have justified it is everything is kind of bullshit even you XXXX, coming off as the savior, the man showing you what is behind the curtain while he has an ad for MacDonald's, to the right of his video. But XXXX I do enjoy you videos, even though your white voice, Mr. XXXX, and I really wish you would post on a regular basis because those mother fuckers want to see your videos and to you guys watching this video; if you are one of those people that's like Phil has taken the suspension and he's doing this; and if you're that stupid then just unsubscribe to me. It's hard to do on the internet, but I would like to minimize the amount of stupid fucks watching my show; or continue watching me and hating me; because haters pay the bills; that's just something on my mind. See you next.","High","High","High"
"VLOG440","New challenge. Okay, so week nine's challenge is to do the hoe down throw down. You know the one that goes boom, boom clap.

Okay, good luck. Peace.","Low","High","Low"
"VLOG441","That is a subtle thing. Let me do it somewhere where it's more visible maybe. Um. Here. There. I like it. Um, yeah, it was on sale so I got it. Uh, yeah they have such crazy eye shadow colors. I bought, like, such boring ones because I'm bored. They have such nice ones like that amazing blue. Just check out the website. I think you can also order; no you can definitely also order. Otherwise there'd be not much point in me showing you all this. Um, they have really, really cool stuff. You have to see it. It's pretty amazing.Then, I got this which I love, I love, I love. This eyebrow marker. Um, it's kind of, like, a eyebrow pencil, but it's a marker. It's got, like, a kind of felt tip here and so it's the only thing I've ever found which is -- works at all. Got perfect that there's always one swipe. You know and I didn't smudge or anything. It's -- I got kind of semi permanent tattooey one. I love it. I love it, love it, love it. Just use it to, like, fill in places in my eyebrows. Okay, I don't have any spaces so there's nothing to fill in, but it's so good. And they have it in three different colors. One is for, um, brunettes and black haired people. One's for red heads. And one's for blondes.Sorry, I'm having problems breathing today. So, I love this. I was gonna buy this. Another thing I love, love, love is this, um, ultra tech mascara. This is so, so -- this is one of the best mascaras I've ever had. I bought it last year 'cause it was -- it was on sale. It wasn't on sale this year, but I still bought it. It's got a, like, tiny little brush with those tiny little bristles which usually isn't a good sign, but this mascara is really, really, really great. I can only recommend it. It's, like, good for everyday. It's not got too much volume. I don't really like that whole volume thing, but it's very, very lengthening and, um, clump and all and I think it's superb. It's really the best mascara I've ever tried. Okay, maybe not the best, but the best for the price at which comes.So, then I got this, um, eye shadow palette, whatever, set kind of thing called back to black. 'Cause I realized I never do smoky eyes and this might just be the perfect thing to do smoky eyes with. Well I thought it was, but let me explain in a second. So, here. It's got, like, different shades of grey and white and black. And I thought it would be really, really perfect, but, um, you'll see I do some swatches that -- I don't know. The colors aren't that great on, you know. Um, they are too sparkly so it's not really smoky eyes, it's just ridiculous. I -- I do like the black; it's very, very good black. You can see; very highly pigmented. Um, but, like, uh, I can't really get it on here. You know -- this grey for example is so shiny. It's, like, sober. I -- I -- I don't enjoy that, no. Um, that was the darker grey and now the lighter grey. It's exactly like the darker grey. There's, like, no difference whatsoever. Actually, now that I look at it like that, there maybe, but it's very hard to see. In fact, this is the lighter one and this one actually looks lighter. This one's more silver, this one's more grey. I don't know. It's -- it's not -- you know. Um, then the white is, I guess, okay, but it's like, uh, too cold for -- you know, there are cold whites and there are warm whites and this is kind of a very icy, almost within, like, slightly blue tinge. I don't know if you can see that, but yeah. So, I'm not that happy with the palette even though it's, you know, it's pretty cool, it's got, like, a mirror and everything and then -- but, uh, I don't know if I'm really gonna find much use for that 'cause those colors also really don't suit me. So, yeah, I'm gonna have to look for someone doing the look with greys and blacks and whites; otherwise I'll have no idea how to do it anyway.Right. Then I got this, uh, lipstick. I don't -- I'm not sure which one it is. Color twenty two. They only have, like, two types of lipstick anyways so I don't know. And it's this, uh, very, very dark red. I shall do a swatch. My hand is getting kind of full here. I love it actually. It's the perfect pin up girl, Bettie Page red. You know, you'd think this was a really common color, but in most drug stores I've not been able to find that. This, like, nice, kind of berry, very wine, dark red, but, like, you could find it, but it's usually too dark and too, like, harsh and this one's still quite playful and cute. And also the lip liner, I bought one matching that. I'm not really into the darker and also it's been impossible to find a color like that. Now, I want it to be darker and then I'll blend them. I can -- actually, you know what, in the next video I'll, um, put the lipstick on so you can see the look. Yeah, and so I've done it like that; I think it's beautiful. Very, Betty Page pin up girl kind of thing.So, yeah, it's a great company with everything I got and, uh, I really, really, really love their stuff. I think it's, you know, it's almost there. It's not quite, I don' t think, up to the standards of, like, Mac and stuff and other professional companies even though it is a professional make up company. Um, but I think it's still very, very good so check out the website. I'll put it in the side and thank you for watching.Actually scratch that. Um, I forgot to say something. One part that I do not recommend by them is this soft color blush. Um, I have one from last year. I didn't buy one this year and it is terrible. It's so highly pigmented. I'm just, like, poking with the brush and I know it's a product brush so I got -- and look at this. I got this, uh, clown. Way too much. You know it's, like, impossible to apply it without looking ridiculous. So, I think, um, with blush also, um, the high quality is not only shown in the pigmentation, but also in how natural it looks and how, like, um, how easy it is to apply.","High","Low","High"

"VLOG45","Hi, it's XXXX I just got back from my trip this weekend. I feel so bad, okay, so I come home and first of all my camera bag did arrive fine but, yeah. I was worried -- I was getting this thing from Amazon Vine and um, somebody would steal it, like, if they would steal a book on Humanor, if they would steal a ukulele why wouldn't they steal a camera bag? The thing keeps -- this bag thing is bigger than my suitcase I'm, like, what I'm suppose to put ten cameras in it what? What? I don't know.I have, like, sort of a professional grade digital camera that I got last year 'cause I'm crazy, I don't know and some different lenses for it and stuff but I'm, like, I could put my camera and all the lenses and, like, my lunch for the next week in it and probably my cat, it's China kitty.Anyway I feel -- so I get the package and then of course I come home to my cats and, like, I'm usually gone for, for two nights in a row and I feel so bad that I'm not there in that sort of that middle day to, like, give them some extra moist food and stuff and I feel like -- I feel like um, she, like -- she wants the attention but she's-- she's, like, I don't know, she's extra, extra, she's extra claws when I -- when she's mad at me and I think she's mad.And she's so skinny. Like, I really noticed it when I have been gone for two nights and when I come back and I swear she's lost another, like, half an ounce or something which for her it's a lot. Yeah so I have a little China kitty here and she's kinda being sweet and she's kinda being mean. I think she's mad, but isn't she cute? Aww, she doesn't like that, very sad.Yeah, so we went to this wedding. I think I had to do another, like, ten more things to do when you're broke video 'cause I thought of some more, yeah, but I don't know if some of those things are good. Like, I was talking about weddings. I was talking about, um, you know, you can go to a wedding and you get free food and everything, but you know my boyfriend and I are vegans so we were really lucky because we know the mother of the bride and she was really sweet and she said, oh I'm going -- ah she said just, like, the day before the wedding, uh, let me try to get you um, the beef entrée without the beef 'cause then you're going to get, like, potatoes and vegetables and stuff where there was a pasta entrée that was, like, cheese lasagna or something and so we couldn't eat that. And she actually remembered to do it so it was awesome, but then it was, like, hey -- hey no fighting, no fighting. Come here Rodney , come here. Come here because you're so cute and we want to sit together and we don't want to fight with China. Oh you're so warm, so cuddly, so cute. Yeah, he's, like, so excited, yeah. We're excited Rodney, we're excited.And um, yeah, so uh, she managed to switch it but we drank maybe a lot of, wine probably because we were a little bored. No, I mean, it was a great wedding it was like, this fairytale Cinderella kind of wedding really nice, but just, like, just boring enough to drink a little too much wine, maybe and that's fine to do once in a while, I guess, unless you don't have very much food. So when you just, like, have a few vegetables and a couple pieces of roasted potato, like, you haven't really had that much to eat.So after the wedding we ended up going to Safeway and trying to find some vegan friendly food. And this is the bad part because you see, I was vegetarian for twenty years and I did spend some time along time ago being vegan too and I read food labels like a maniac. So if you want to know vegan junk food? Like, I can tell you vegan junk food and part of our reason for eating vegan is to eat healthy. So what good is it to know what junk foods are vegan? Like, you know what kind of cookies are vegan or whatever? It doesn't do you any good. So we went -- we got a bunch of crap. We went and got a bunch of crap, yeah.So um, yeah, my point is what good does it do to go to a wedding and, you know, like, you're getting free food at the wedding, but then you're vegan. Uh, yeah, it doesn't -- doesn't do much good.And then for just total humiliation, like, I brought this dress to wear, really nice dress and um, I saw that It was too small for me yeah because I am too fat. I was too fat to wear that dress. So we went to an outlet mall and my boyfriend bought me a new dress which looked quite similar to the old dress only it was a size larger and not as nice. It wasn't as nice of a dress. It was very similar. It was almost the same only not as nice and -- and with and ugly neckline but um, he bought me this dress and a purse. Actually the purse is really nice and now I wish that it wasn't in my luggage because I would show you the purse is awesome. So I totally scored this cool dressy purse even though my video camera doesn't fit in it very well. So that's not good but , like, look China stole my spot, oh so sad, yeah.So humiliating dress didn't fit, had to get a new one, wasn't quite as nice and my boyfriend is, like, you have to wear nylons because -- or stockings whatever because they look nice, they look so elegant and whatever and I'm, like, well they're not comfortable and I'm already wearing body suit. I have to wear the nylons and put the body suit over it and I'm, like, not comfortable. And he's, like, sometimes to look really good, you have to suffer a little bit.And I was thinking of my mom 'cause I don't know what she used to be doing. Like, if my grandmother used to be doing something to her hair or whatever it was and my mom would complain and -- and my grandmother would say, well you have to suffer to be beautiful. My mom would say, well I don't want to be beautiful. And, um yeah, it made me think of that. But uh, it made me many things, it made me think of that but uh, I guess it is all a matter of balances.But then you look around and you see people that look very nice that maybe aren't wearing nylons and you're, like -- you're thinking, like, I think he just, you just don't have to wear them in California or something. What the heck? why am I wearing these? Silly, I don't know. I'm not sure if I agree with, like, the whole you have to wear nylons thing ever in California. I think there should be a law passed against it. I would totally vote in favor of the no nylons no stocking -- well stockings are okay. But no nylons, no nylons.But we discovered this awesome noodle bar and we're, like, now we want to check out every noodle bar in the Bay Area 'cause we're, like, noodle bars rule. And we went there twice and um, what else? We went to Lodi on the way to Sacramento and we went to Load Eye again on the way back and uh, on the way back was really cool because the second winery we went to the owner of the winery was there and he was, just, like, a total wine geek and he was, like, you know, I guess he though we were pretty cool so he was going -- running in the back and, like, getting barrel samples out and bringing out for us to taste and stuff. And it was just -- and the wine was good too so that was awesome.And um, yeah, oh, oh we went to Shevi's tonight. Shevi's, what the heck I don't even know why we pick Shevi's. I had, like, guacamole which at least they make their own guacamole from scratch right at your table; that's kinda cool. Guacamole, corn tortillas, which I like except that the ones my boyfriend make are, like, a hundred times better and um, beans -- black beans that's what I had, and -- oh, like, a margarita the size of my head, like, gra -- grande, a grande margarita. Way too big, actually I didn't even finish it. Yeah, and uh, yeah.And I have really been perfecting the technique of keeping my boyfriend awake when he's driving because I'm never driving on trips. He's the one doing the driving. But I am, like, the master. I just keep him awake. Ah yeah, currently -- I need more, better songs on my iPod Nano though now that we have the cord to plug that into his -- his car. If we both sing along to songs on -- on there it uh, it really keeps us awake. It makes the time go really fast. I'm sure we sound completely ridiculous, but it's fun right? Yeah so, anyway.Now we're looking forward to Halloween. We've got Halloween coming up and we are totally not ready for it and I'm freaking out. I don't know about him, but I'm panicking. I'm panicking -- hu -- hu -- hu -- and I think that I might have volunteered to spend the day at his house putting up Halloween decorations. I mean that's cool, you know.Like, we had to take a client of his out to dinner and then the next night -- or no, his business partner and then the next night his accountant or vice versa and I said, well maybe in between I could stay at your house and put up Halloween decorations, but I thing that means that I actually signed up to hangout with his mother all day because she lives there and I'm, like, oh no, are you serious?Yeah, so that's going to be my week.","Low","Low","Low"

"VLOG47","﻿Hey guys. It is week number three into my weight loss journey. I hope you guys are still interested. Ah anyway, I wanted to talk to you guys about my past weight loss. So let's get started. I made a little weight loss timeline and also graphs because I'm a nerd. So I made a little weight loss time line. Here it is. Okay, so I am a baby over here and then basically what I have learned is that every time I move to a new state, I gained weight. So I lived in Texas when I was a baby up until when I was twelve years old, we moved to Ohio. I gained weight because that's a really stressful time. You're trying to make friends. You don't have any friends. It's just stressful. Twelve months later, no, it was sixteen, we move to Minnesnowta, right over here, oh right here. So that caused some weight gain too because, ha ha, I just made some friends in Ohio and then we had to leave so I comforted my pain with food, okay, and then over here I went to college in Wisconsinsin,  as my sister would call it, and that caused some weight gain because that's college, stressful. As you also saw on my timeline, I had World War One and World War Two, not exactly. Um, I had weight watchers one and weight watchers two.Okay, so, take the challenge, get a pedometer, if you want, um, they are wonderful to help you lose weight. Um, they recommend you; if you want to stay fit you walk six thousand to eight thousand steps a day. If you want to lose weight they recommend that you walk about ten thousand steps a day in which part of those ten thousand steps, I think you have to walk -- walk four thousand in one go -- so, a big walk. Um, that's basically what I'm going to be doing. I'm going to be trying to get to ten thousand every day -- except for today since I just picked this up. They are not very expensive. This one was seven dollars at WalMart. There were five dollar ones but this one I opted for because it has this little strap. Because I have bought so many in the past that I -- they fall off and I lose them so this will catch it if it tries to fall off of me. So I'm going to try to walk ten thousand steps starting tomorrow. It will be awesome. Um, next week, however -- I might not have this video up on time. It's going to be a little late, probably a lot late. I'm going to be driving back to school next week. It will be awesome. I'm going, uh -- the problem is my school is ten hours away from here, although it will probably be twelve hours when you count Chicago traffic, weather and everything else. So, I am going to go which ever day is going to give me the best driving conditions, um, depending on the Indiana toll way and the most of Wisconsin. So that's that. It will probably be a day late, so -- because I'm thinking I'm going to go head out on Monday. So yeah, um, I want to hear how you guys -- you guys have been. If weather has been great or if you new to this, to say hi. I would love that. That's about it. I will see you guys next week and have a wonderful week.","Low","High","High"

"VLOG49","Inglorious Bastards, the new Quentin Tarantino movie that came out on Friday, but I saw it on Saturday, why? Because, I'm bad ass. So, I kind of figured I'd do a review right now, but I'd like to add in that it is one in the morning. So, if this is not the greatest review, it's because I'm freaking tired. Anyway, let's get started.So, the main thing that attracted me to this movie was the fact that it's a Quentin Tarantino movie, and I'm a huge Quentin Tarantino fan. Um, right now I'd just like to say, em, it was he -- did a very good job in the film, it was all well done, stuff like that. Um, but I wouldn't say it was his best film, because a lot of people out there are saying that this is one of -- this is his best film he's ever made. I beg to differ; it was Reservoir dogs, just saying. But it is indeed one of his better films that he has made, so just throwing that out there.Now, let's get off with some of the goods and the bads. So, one of the things I loved in this movie was, Brad Pitt's acting. Because his accent was -- it -- his accent added humor, and is just a really good accent, and you know, his -- he made the movie funny, but also was -- he did -- really actiony and stuff like that. Um, kind of jumbled up right there, but his acting in general, he was great in it. That also leads to one of those -- those flaws, and to me, it seemed like he didn't have that much screen time, because you see him for about ten minutes, and then you don't see him again for another half hour. Um, he probably had about fifty minutes screen time -- I -- I can't remember how long the movie is, I know it's at least two hours. But, I know it's a good thing sometimes when you don't see the star that much, because it adds, you know, more screen time for people that are unknown, and stuff like that, but, um, with his acting -- when his acting is that great, you kind of want to see him more, I guess. So, ah, that's just one thing.Um, one of the other good things about this movie was the screen transitions. Like, it wasn't just a bunch of random stuff happening, but the screen transitions were well placed, they were well laid out, and stuff like that. Um, that also kind of led to something else, like, um, a really good, good scene would happen -- um, I don't want to spoil too much, -- but like a really actiony scene would happen, but then it would jump into the next scene, and the next scene would be kind of boring; not that great. Um, but, some of the scenes were stretched out, like, there was unneeded dialogue, nothing really important happened. Um, for example, this is a minor spoiler for people out there, the tavern scene where they're, um, all, dressed up like Nazi's and talking to that -- um, one of the in command guys for the Nazi army, um, like, maybe five seconds of the entire scene were important to the -- to the rest of the movie, but the rest of the stuff was just thrown in there, not really needed, like, they spent thirty minutes taking about random stuff, and then another thirty minutes playing a game, and, I -- I found it kind of boring, and I had to, like, I almost, kind of, fell asleep during that scene. But trust me, it's worth it to watch it, if you've seen the movie already. If not, go see it, but that comes later.Um, another good thing I liked, and I keep saying that -- it's been kind of repetitive, but whatever -- um, was the chapter format. Like, it's like -- it's basically, like, literally, a moving book, because it'll say chapter one, and then at the end of that chapter, you'll see chapter two and stuff. And I just thought that was kind of cool, because it's like, kind of like a book, and that -- that -- that goes back to the screen transitions, because it was like, you're just flicking through a book and reading it. That's -- I liked it. I'm probably weird, but yeah.Um, going back to Brad Pitt's acting though, the humor in this movie was, great. It was well placed too; there wasn't too much humor and there wasn't too less humor -- if that makes sense? Um, Brad Pitt's character was the funniest, but a lot of one liners came from other characters during really serious moments, so if you're really tensing up and feeling that something's going to happen, there's going to be at least one, good, one liner that's thrown in there that makes the movie funny. It's kind of like a dark comedy, because it's kind of hard to make World War Two funny and all the Jewish stuff that's going on. But -- yeah, the humor -- like I said, the humor was good.They, um, actually I thought this was more of a humorous film than an action film, and that's kind of saying a lot, being that it's a war -- it's a war movie, but -Um, so this --this-- this is one of Brad Pitt's greatest movies -- that's what I think, but I haven't really seen a lot of his movies, but it's definitely his greatest film in the last five years, at least. Um, but moving on.Um, this one is just a bad thing, um, the subtitles, because three -- um, French is used in the movie, German's used in the movie, and obviously English is, but he had to use German and French subtitles, um. The subtitles were good, but it's like, they'll be speaking French, and then the subtitles -- if they say, like, merci or Mademoiselle, they'd actually put down those words, they wouldn't say -- they wouldn't put what they actually mean in English. But then sometimes they did, so it's kind of confusing, because sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. And I just thought that was kind of weird, maybe they could have worked on that just a little bit more, but yeah.So, like I said, fantastic movie, I really loved it. Um, final rating, I would give it A-. It's a really good movie; I really recommend you go see it, right now. It's not as gory as you think it would be, but hey, it attracted me, so take a look at it guys. It's definitely one of Quentin Tarantino's best works, so, yeah, that concludes my one in the morning review.I'm going to get some freaking sleep. Goodbye.","High","High","High"
"VLOG5","Doing a standard re tweet themed, so web two point zero, and you guys know how I roll, I'm all three point zero up in here. Anyway, I got a message about CD's, umm, she, here I -- I -- you know I finally hear at three forty seven A. M. , I got to watch her Actions Talk, umm, episode -- I don't know what to call it -- like, interview? It's on Actions Talk about her website, sohobiztube.So, I'm -- I'm throwing this on the twitter, and the link to her interview is uh, you're on the YouTube right now, and the link is right there. But I wanted to say a -- a few things about CD. CD is the person who saw me speak one day and put me on the cover of her magazine here. That I am, looking all -- looking all something. Um, and she's putting together this website, sohobiztube, which a -- whose goal I guess is to be -- she says the YouTube for businesses, but I -- you know, I look forward to umm, businesses getting schooled in the arts of picking up a little, uh, digital camera like I have here, and running around their business like, hey, look at my business, look at my business, and then putting it on the internet. That'll be, that'll be awesome, you gotta have more of that.Oh here, I have my old broken camera. See businesses, you can take your camera, and then you can record like this, and then you can put it on sohobiztube, and connect with other elite business ninjas on the interwebs. Ok the -- I -- anyway - the, the video is actually good. There's some cool, insightful stuff in there. It's ten minutes, which at, you know, at first, you know for us A. D. H. D. internet people you're like oh no, but, it's worth sitting down through it and watching it.And I'm going to, uh, release you from this, uh, uh, video experience, and uh, go -- go check her out. I'll put her twitters and my twitters and the link to the video over there. And check out the other Actions Talk videos if you're into being an entrepreneur and being up at three A.

"VLOG50","All right. Well, uh, turn to your textbooks in, uh, page twenty yeah. Now, the thing we are going to talk about the Spaniards. And, you guys know, the Spaniards were -- they were Catholic, you know. Uh, I went to a Catholic, uh, school -- Catholic school, uh, you know. But, I was cool. I was a cool Catholic kid, you know.I had dreadlocks and, you know, I -- I wore rusty colors. It was -- I was the back in the day. I still am you know, I can skate board, you know. because you gotta get serious, because you have A. P. test that means you have to pass.Okay, something I hate about my school, hmm, this is going to be a long list, so I'm going to spare you guys and I'm only gonna name one thing. My school is a uniform enforced school. We have a uniform dress code. Fun, I know. And, um, you know, they're pretty strict about it. I just -- I hate it, because they actually pay people to stay at the front gates and make sure you are in uniform. Because of that, I also hate the faculty. Every single one of them, even the teachers. Yeah.One thing that I actually like about, um, my school is the schedule, you know, 'cause we -- our schedule is weird. It's not just like one through seven every single day. It's -- we have blocks. So, um, every other day we have either the even numbered periods or the odd numbered periods. So, Monday would be like one, three, five and seven, and then Tuesday would be two, four, six and eight. Yeah, the classes are longer, but you kind of just learn how to deal with them. But, it gives you more time to do homework; we get more breaks and yeah. Okay, see you guys next week, or will I? Hmmm.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG51","﻿And then fill this one out for dinner, a little pepper, you whip it, and have a great salad. Delicious.So, I kind of want to show you, um, a bit, about what it took to make the desktop that I made for my blog. I always make a desktop every month and I thought I'd show you a bit of behind the scenes. Um, it looks like it's all, like, hand drawn and it is all hand drawn, but a lot of the work and the composition is put together in Photoshop.So, I'll show you each of individual drawings. That's the main and it's just all done in pen. And little frowny bits, nothing special and then the flowers that went behind them. See, all I did was scan them all in and, uh, get rid of the background and Photoshop, and apply a couple of textures that I have and actually also did just a plain wash sort of background behind it and, um, yeah, that's how I made it.Sounds like it just took just five minutes, but it didn't. It took quite a few hours actually. Um, yeah, it's very you like it and I like making them for you. It kind of pushes me and helps me find new techniques for things and how I wanna draw basically in my old career, I guess. Uh, so, I'm glad that people give me the opportunity to do and then they don't totally hate them.You have a great night, great day and see you.﻿Um, there was also Nigel B. Canon's work which was great and also Courtney Broone . She does the most beautiful, like, little pencil drawings. They're really amazing when you get to see them up close. So -﻿Hi.

It sucks a bit, but I've worked out how to do it, I'm happy with that; so, here it goes.See, I just , wow that was the coolest thing I could do. Of course, there are a lot of other cool things I can do, like making it a bit more black and white now. See, and now giving it color back. So, learned how to do a couple of things, I might get , I don't know, there might be a better editing software. But I want to work out how to do green screen as well, because I can just go to the stationers and buy some green bits of card, that would be cool to do that kind of thing.So this is probably going to be my last video before Christmas, so hope everybody have a nice Christmas. Good luck to and XXXX for their videos. They have just started making videos. So basically that's what I've got for this video.Merry Christmas to everybody. I hope everybody liked my copyright video, it almost got the most amount of use from all of my videos, so thanks for watching that. Um, I'd just like to say a Merry Christmas as well to Greg, yep.

I wish we could a did more but everybody was too busy, but you can always - I'm not leaving. Like everybody else, I'm not leaving YouTube, so I don't understand why we have to quit.

"VLOG56","﻿Hey, what's up? Whatchya doing? I'm not doing anything, and it's Friday. And I should be doing, like, everything today 'cause I have no work tomorrow. It's, like, the beginning of the weekend, and no school or anything tomorrow. But I have nothing to do, really.Because I can't afford to drive to see my friends, so I'm kinda like stuck here. And it's really lame. I have nothing to do. So I decided to make a YouTube video and, um, it's kinda a pointless one, so I'm really sorry.But I -- I didn't realize that, um, on my eighteenth birthday I got myself a present and I never showed you. It's kind of, um, not showing up as much as it was, but, um, this is it. Yep. It says, The Used, and it's, like, a copy off of, um, Brandon , a drummer from The Used -- the old drummer from The Used. He had the same tattoo, so I -- I had to copy it.Yeah, yeah, if I had a scooter -- which is what I want, or a moped -- uh, it would, like, fix everything. Even though it's, like, freezing outside right now, I'd still take my scooter out and go to wherever the fuck I want, because I don't want to be here right now. I want to be with friends and, um -- but I can't afford to drive that far. It really sucks. But a scooter would, like, make everything better.So. I don't even have, like, people to talk to online, right now. Because normally I do. Normally I'm talking to people and, uh, I'm not. Like, they're not on, so I'm really bored. I have nothing to do. My sister's asleep. Would somebody entertain me? This camera's not working. Doesn't, like, I don't know -- talking to a camera doesn't really entertain me all that much. Believe it or not. Uh, . Oh yeah, fucking gag me with a spoon, Jesus Christ. This video is retarded.Cat? Tiger? I don't know if you've seen my cat, Tiger. He's, uh, the one with the flat face. You know, he's a Himalayan -- I don't. I don't even know if you've seen him before. But, uh, like, he's dying. It's a happy subject. He has bone cancer, and it's, like, this lump on his back is pretty gross. And, uh, I asked my mom if I could have a cat, a brand new kitten, because I really want a kitten, like, really bad. And she said not 'til Tiger dies. How fucking morbid is that? Yeah, I had to share that.Oh my God, I have to tell you. We -- I'm really scared that I'm repeating a story that I've already told you, but, um, I work at a bookstore right next to PetCo. And, at PetCo, they had, um, two lizards -- a male and a female -- escape. And they laid eggs somewhere, but they don't really know where. And randomly, we got, like, this little baby lizard in our toilet. And we didn't know there was, like, two lizards escaped and they're -- were hatching eggs. It was the weirdest thing, because there was just a baby lizard in our toilet. Like, what the fuck? So, um, my co worker grabbed it out of the toilet and went over to PetCo and bought a cage at her -- um, aquarium -- and, like, a heat rock and stuff. And now the lizard's name is Toilet. Yeah, that's my story.Oh, but I have more work stories. Um, fuck. I don't know if I said this or not. I'm really sorry if I'm repeating stuff. Um, but one day, uh, my manager walked into the store and, like, walked to the back and somebody had, like, tried to pry open the office, which is where we keep, like, all the money. That's where the safe is and stuff. And, uh, like, one of the back doors had been opened and, so somebody was in there at some point in time, hiding in there when uh, me and my co worker, Ashley, were closing. Like, somebody hid in the store and we locked them in and then they tried to break in and steal money. Like, what the fuck? And we figured it was probably in the bathroom, but -- that's kind of a scary thought, is it not? Like, somebody was hiding in there when I closed the store.Damn it, I keep having, like, random stuff to talk about. But, um, people like to mention how I, like, rock back and forth, or I -- I close part of my mouth or something when I -- when I'm talking to the camera. It's all 'cause I'm really fucking shy. That's all. And I don't know; I am a little bit more calm today. My Mom's not here, so I don't have to worry about like waking her up or anything. But, uh, I'm just really pretty shy. I'm surprised that I don't stutter throughout my videos, because when I get nervous, I usually do. So, um, you know about that part, but, I mean, I mumble and I close part of my mouth sometimes and just like move around a whole lot. And sometimes my hands are roaming crazy, and I'm just, like, laughing at myself the entire time. So, I just want you guys to know that I'm -- I'm really fucking shy.Like, I -- I'm scared to call people. I've paid my sister to make phone calls for me. I -- I can't go to, like, a gas station and talk to the person behind the counter for, like, more than like, a second. I can say like, thanks, and that's about it. I can't, like, ever remember if I'm trying to buy gas and I can't pre pay, I never, like, remember what pump I'm even at, and, like, how much money I'm putting in. Like, it's, yeah.And I say like a lot. I know you've probably really noticed that way too much, but, um, yeah. Um, I'm -- I'm sorry about that part. Can't really help it. But, uh, it -- it's all just 'cause I'm -- I'm really shy.Like, I basically went through, like, I don't know, all of middle school almost not even talking. So I'm also a major dork and I can't believe I just admitted that I, like, didn't talk to people. I mean, I did occasionally, but, um, there were definitely some days when I, like, almost go the entire day without talking.Now I'm just a really fucking Emo and weird. I'm a little better now. Um, I talk to cameras. I just made myself pretty much, like, die right now. Breathe. All right.Oh my God. Shitty video number one thousand six.The end.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG57","﻿So on the internet, I've always been really open about myself, my thoughts, my personality. I don't let any of it -- I don't hold any of it back, most of the time, and that usually works out pretty well for me. But it's gotten to a point where I'm starting to question. Uh, not question myself but question how I act on the internet. Does that make any sense?Um, Facebook. Facebook has basically ruined everything for me. MySpace did and didn't. It's much bigger with Facebook, because with Facebook, there are people that watch me on Facebook that -- or that I'm friends with on Facebook, I guess -- that I knew when I was in, like, high school and some of them are my teachers from high school, who really aren't that much young -- that much older than me, actually.But I went to a Christian school, and back when I went to that school, I was really quiet. I was shy. I was withdrawn. I didn't really take good care of myself. I would -- I was kind of a slob, and uh, so, a lot of people when they think back to me they probably have that kind of vision in their head and that's not who I am anymore.I am not quiet, I am not a prude. I am -- I still consider myself a good person. I still -- I'm still very spiritual. I still love God, but I have a potty mouth and I like bad things, and I think I'm okay with that. But -- but -- but -- I -- I originally connected my Facebook to my Twitter because my -- you know, I was never updating my Facebook and I thought the only way I could really update my Facebook was if I connected it to Twitter.But I'm kind of paranoid now. I'm kind of -- sometimes I -- I sensor myself. I tone down the potty mouth, and I -- I tone down the really stupid shit, because I'm thinking, oh man, those people from all those years ago, they're gonna read that and they're gonna think what the -- what the holy hand happened to her.And -- and I hate feeling, like, I have to do that. And apparently it's the same, like, the same way with employers. Now, like, anyone looks up my name, they'll see all the stupid shit I do, and probably they won't have the best impression.But then the question then becomes, do I need to sensor myself for these people? To be considered good enough for these people? Um, I don't think so, I don't think I should have to. But the question is still there and -- and so I'm constantly questioning myself, should I say that, should I say the F word, should I say hell, should I say damn, will that offend somebody, and have -- make them think less of me? And, why should I fucking care? It's the fucking internet. If you can't handle it, get off the fucking internet.I'm sorry. I'm really distracted. It's snowing outside. It's Houston; it's snowing outside. It's kinda freaking me out. Um, but yeah! Um, so, what would you do? Would you try to sensor yourself to make -- because I mean, there's all this shit I do. There's my blogs that I do that I -- I plainly say, my name is XXXX, hi, how are you doing? You know, all of my comics, my really stupid, stupid comics have my name on them. All the stupid phantom stuff I do, like, the Nintendo stuff, the video game music, it's all right there with my name on it, and anyone who looks up XXXX is going to see this dork.So should I hold that back, or should I just be fucking honest? And I've always felt that honesty was the best policy when it came to this kind of stuff, but, do -- should I clean up my internet image and keep the F words, and whatever else behind some kind of lock so only certain people can read them?But I hate that. I hate the thought of not freely expressing myself. So, there you have it.Yeah. Let's go look the snow.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG58","﻿Hey, how's it going everyone? Um, it's a quarter to six on Monday. Um, so I just put together a, uh, a clip from not too long into my program. We had a special class where we got to experience Japanese tea ceremony. Um, and so I have a little clip at the beginning of what you're supposed to do when you first enter a tea room. I'll show you that here in a second.So there was only two of us that actually came to this, uh, even though there were supposed to be a lot more who were supposed to show up. So we got into the little entryway, the gankong and I screwed up and it's a different kind of gankong than in typical, um, typical homes. This was a special tea room that was located inside the school. So I go in there and I walk in the wrong place with my shoes on, getting a little scolding. Moved into the tea room and -- little thing about Japanese tea ceremonies, they're interesting, cultural, historic -- they suck. It's one of those things, I'm sure -- I haven't climbed Fuji, but I'm -- I'm assuming it's similar to that. It is something you do once to say you did it and then you probably won't want to do it again. I'd probably rather climb Fuji naked than do tea ceremony again. Primarily because of seiza.Sitting seiza, uh, sucks. I thought I was prepared for this, I practiced at home. I sat on my carpeting. Now there's a big difference between tatami mats and carpeting, because basically tatami mats is concrete. Okay, it's not concrete, but it's -- it's, you know, the -- sort of straw like stuff, um, I'll show that in another video sometime, but it's -- it's basically they lay it on concrete, um, compared to my nice, uh, carpeted floors. It was not fun to sit on your legs. It sounds easier than it is for me, mainly because I have really long legs. Um, I'm a tall guy, it was really awkward for me to be doing that, but, you know, we got to experience cool little things. They are very particular about how you, ah, take, um, you know, the cups. You have to turn it special ways. I don't really remember it, because I screwed up pretty much the entire time, I did the -- the ceremony, because I kept fidgeting and stuff, trying to get comfortable.Um, but yeah, we got to get little Japanese sweets. I mean there's not a whole lot to really tell about -- about the ceremony in terms of specifics. Um, there are definitely resources out there if you want to know exactly how it works, it sort of varies, too. Um, one thing that's interesting, is my teachers there were saying that Japanese tea ceremonies really aren't so much about the rules as they seem, but about doing these -- these little traditions to make everyone feel comfortable and to feel, um, part of this same group and you know, it's really --it's supposed to be about your conversations with each other and, um, you know, just having a good time. That's definitely the main point. But, uh, yeah, seiza sucks, except for my friend Paul, the other guy that was there, yeah, yeah, so he just sat there like there's nothing. He's like, yeah I sit like this every day, ha, ha man. I looked like a retard.When I was doing my culture classes, one of the old guys that taught us, he's supposedly like the oldest baseball player of all time. He gave us a little -- little tip that you guys should try out because I tried it and I think it's true. So, we were talking about Korea one day and he was saying that apparently you can tell the difference between a Korean and a Japanese woman based on their legs. Now this is because Japanese women apparently -- apparently most Japanese women have bowed legs, meaning they kind of -- I can't really do it with my fingers, but sort of something like that. You know there's kind of a round gap here, right. Well, apparently, Korean women don't have this and the reason for that is because Japanese women traditionally always sat seiza from like, a really early age and Korean women will sit like, sideways, like. We went out there and, uh, it's very easy to spot, because pretty much all the pants that women wear, especially in Japan -- Japanese women are so skintight there's nothing left to the imagination, so you can pretty much see the entirety of, ah, the leg structure of the woman. So, though I didn't get out my protractor to measure the exact angle that they were bowed, I was pretty sure, ah, from then on out who was Japanese and who was Korean. That's an interesting factoid taught to me by a very, very old, ah, Japanese man.So, anyways the, ah, following clip is showing me getting prepared to go in to the tea ceremony.","Low","High","High"
"VLOG59","Hi. I think we can resume. If not then I have no idea. Um, I thought my bedroom's getting like really boring so I decided, hey why not blog in the living room, so that's what I'm doing.

"VLOG6","Hello, and welcome to the XXXX. My name's XXXX and the following is written by David Thorney, Thorney, ney, nei, Tho -- Thoreau, Thor, Thor -- I don't know if the E is silent.Welcome to the XXXX, where we XXXX report.Obviously, having your own monkey would be a fantastic idea, because they're quite intelligent and yet unable to speak. They have the advantage of learning quickly through beatings while being unable to tell anyone. Below, is a list of the kind of monkeys that would be good to have. The list is far from complete as it omits Jet Ski Monkey, Boiling Water Monkey, Battlestar Galactica Monkey, but covers the basic best kind of monkey there is, Disguise Monkey, monkey that wears a disguise.If I had a monkey, I would borrow my mom's sewing machine and make my monkey a little monkey suit. Then if anyone said that's not a real monkey, it's just a monkey suit, I can see the zipper, I could say, I bet you fifty dollars it's a real monkey. And when they say that seems like unreasonable, but you're on, my monkey would take off the monkey suit, and they would have to pay me fifty dollars, and I would buy drugs with the fifty dollars, for the monkey so that he could live with himself for having to live inside a monkey suit all day.Gambling Monkey, monkey that likes to gamble. If I had a monkey, I would teach him how to count cards like Dusting Hoffman in Rain Man, and sneak my monkey into a casino. And if anyone said, that's a monkey, whose monkey is that, I would say that is not my monkey. Channel changing Monkey, monkey that changes channels. If I had a monkey, I would teach how to use all of the entertainment equipment. I would save money on batteries for the remote controls by having my monkey change the channels for me. With the money I'd save on batteries, I would buy drugs. I would share the drugs with my monkey, while we watched Black Books and Stephen Chow movies. Surveillance Monkey, monkey surveils. If I had a monkey, I would teach him to track down people who annoy me, by using their profile photo and Google maps. Using an earpiece to communicate, I would have my monkey conceal himself behind the person typing on Facebook. And when that person wrote something stupid, I would have my monkey run up and slap them on the back of the head really hard, and then make a quick escape. Having several monkeys would be more convenient, but I don't have time to train seven monkeys, with having to do my own hair in the morning and all. Web monkey, monkey on the web. If I had a monkey, I would teach it download porn for me. This way I could spend my time watching it instead of looking for it. I estimated this would save me a hundred and thirty seven hours a week. I would obviously require a monkey with similar taste for mine, but how hard can it be to find a monkey with a fondness for pregnant German women, in latex. Monkey monkey, monkey monkey monkey. That's my monkey.Final summation, having a monkey sounds like a lot of fun. In the comments below, what would you train your monkey to do? I bet it's dirty, o ho, o ho. The best comments are going to make it onto the next show.And I love you, have a wonderful day. Muah. Kisses to your mom, because she knows you know that I know that we know what we both might not know. Lord.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG60","﻿It's been a bit of a while. Um, yeah. I almost didn't film this because I looked at my face and said, Mary , your eyebrows are out of control and you haven't put any makeup on for weeks. Why? It's isn't true -- no, it is true.You might be able to hear a leaf blower outside. I keep looking at myself -- it's been a while. Okay, I'm gonna quickly do this before my computer goes way too hot -- hachoo, hachoo, hachoo. These are computer noises. Oh, you can see a man.Hi. So I recorded this vlog and then my computer crashed. Yay, technology. I'm so happy about it. Ah! So I decided just to do it all over again because I went off on this tangent about things that I realized I -- it isn't that I shouldn't be talking about them, it's just like, why am I talking about them? Why? Why? Why? Sorry, I was just -- yeah. Anyhow.So, uh, I've been busy working, as I do. If you follow me on Twitter -- and you should -- then you, you know, read a lot of tweets about, like, sitting in the street, and I'm painting shoes, and I'm working on the website, and I'm painting other stuff and bein' artsy as I do. It's my job. Or I just did the shop update or whatever -- whatever I do or, you know, things like I had to pee, pee!Um, yes, my roots are back. A month ago I got my hair dyed up again and I had my roots and, uh, my eyebrows look, like, quite insane. So I'm just bringing back the eighties. Yeah.Shoes. Do, do, do, do, do. I wanna give you guys music and I figured if I could just make my own music. It should be finished today. Um, anyways -- I should just make my own music with my mouth, then they wouldn't take my video off the YouTubes for copyright infringement.Speaking of copyright infringement, this is hilarious and I realize now that I should've grabbed it earlier, but I just thought about it -- about it. Um, about three weeks ago, I got -- maybe it was two weeks ago -- it had to be right about three -- three weeks ago I got a message from a friend of mine. She said, Mary, go to this LiveJournal shop, there's something -- stuff of yours that I don't think you licensed. And I was like, what? That's me, like, going there, I was like, boodaloodle . Uh, so I boodaloodaloodled .Uh, my computer is really heating up again. Hold on. Okay. It just got brighter in here. Sorry for all the really bad cuts, I just wanna get through this story, um, and then I'll tell you guys about the sale and I'll leave, because I haven't really got much for an update and I look worse for wear.So I went to the shop and saw that they were selling the shirt that did contain my artwork and, uh, was apparently bought at an Australian shop. So I contacted the people at the Australian shop and they said they only bought five of these shirts, uh, at a shop stall in, I think, Bangkok, Thailand. So, um, it's from a company called Happy Hippie be cool T shirt suite.So I bought the shirt from a person on, uh, LiveJournal and this is it, and as you can see, it is indeed my work. But it's really bad, you can just -- you can't make it out on here, um, but you can actually see all the pixels and it looks faded but it's just because the ink -- uh, since it was blown up, instead of having it blurred, uh, you know, and all pixel y, uh, you can see through it to the actual shirt material. And the ink is, like, every other pixel. So, yeah. That's the worst quality I've ever seen. But it made me laugh, so there you go. Bootleg a Mary Tanner T shirts. You can get them in Bangkok. It's messed up.Um, aside from that fun, I'm trying to think -- I don't know what else has been going on. There's some videos that I wanted to put up. Having a lot of issues with my computer lately. I don't like it. I just got this thing in, like, December.Anyhow, so I'm working on shoes. Um, there's a huge shop sale, and the link is over there and it's my Etsy shop. You buy two necklaces, you get one free. You buy two phone trams, you get one free. If you buy two art prints, you get one free. Uh, if you buy two rings, you get one free. And if you live in the US and you spend over thirty dollars, you get free shipping -- and that's thirty dollars before the shipping charges are applied.Um, aside from that -- in order to do it you have to actually go through, um, pay for it. So you'd add, like three necklaces and then I'll refund you the money for one of those necklaces because that's the only way I could work it out with PayPal and with Etsy.So have fun. There's tons of stuff in the shop. I, uh, have been advertising everywhere I possibly can and I'm gonna go continue to paint. I got a huge shipment of uh, paint and clay and canvas and masonite boards and and I'm very excited to get started in with it, but first I have to do other work and I have to, uh, you know, go wax my eyebrows or something. I don't know, what do ladies do? As if being a lady.I like making stupid faces. It's fun -- fun! Oh, also I wanna have a live show eventually again, I just don't know when. And my biggest thing is I don't know uh, how my computer can handle it. Uh, uh, yeah, it really sucks. I freed up a whole bunch of space so I can be faster -- it's not that. I think I just need a different laptop cooler because this one is crap.I have weird teeth. My teeth are weird. I'm gonna keep commenting about myself. Any disparaging remarks I say about myself -- it's not so you guys go, no, you're fine. Oh no, no, no, we all look horrible equally. It's fun. I like to be self deprecating, not 'cause I'm fishing for compliments -- I don't want the compliments. It's okay, okay?I've missed you guys. I've missed this. I've missed this. This -- it's something I've missed. I've missed it. I've missed it so much that I actually grew these little side pieces out again had a may just go. They're back. They're back. They're back. They're ba -- this is why you watch vlogs, okay? They're back. They're back. Oh, you know what? Um, there are some other things I would like to, um -- go vote for my design at infectious dot com. It's where skate deck -- it's their, uh, pop deck contest. It's really cool. The contest, I mean.Uh, what else is over there? I don't know what else is over there. Whatever I put there. Go join the sidebox do do do do do . I'll have more regular vlogs once the website's up again, and then the vlog is okay just in the website itself. Then you can go dot com or you can just continue to subscribe here. Whatever. You'll be right there.And I was gonna, uh -- embed, like, WordPress or have my website be WordPress theme and I just wasn't smart enough to do it, and plus I was, like, I just bought Dreamweaver, I might as well use it. So I just went with, like, you know, frames and called it a night. I was gonna say called it a day, but let's face it -- I don't work in no daytime. It looks a lot brighter than it is out there -- it's sunset time. It's sunset time.Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun lady computer.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG61","Well, got an interesting email the other day. Why do I make videos that are so graphic, violent, always talking about death and everything else? It's real simple. I sort of hope this answers your question, if not I don't know what to tell you.It's called my disorder. That's what goes through my head. That's how I can express how I feel and what I'm really thinking. And so, it just happens to bleed out on YouTube. If you don't like it, don't watch it. I don't care, because this is for me; not anybody else. If it helps other people to understand more about my disorder, great; I love it. But if it offends you or if it's not PC, whatever, get the fuck off my page.I am sick and tired of dealing with bullshit of other people who get easily offended. Oh my God, it's not politically correct. Oh my God, that is just too graphic. I don't care. Like I said, it's for me. If other people can get something out of it, cool. So, you know, you're on YouTube. Okay, YouTube is not exactly known for polit -- politically correctness. This is a place where people can freely express themselves through video. I'm -- I'm -- sorry. I'm just really, really frustrated with people who email me saying that, oh my God it's so detrimental to the young people.Damn it, young people shouldn't be seeing this shit. The young people should not be on the internet unsupervised. So, you know, if they get traumatized by this, not my fault. That would be the parent's fault who's supposed to be supervising their children while they're on the internet. Because, you know, then they'll run across a porn site -- what are you gonna do, blame the porn site? I don't know. All right. I hope that answers people's questions about why my videos are always graphic; are always violent or whatever. And please continue to view, because, you know, I really do think people can get something out of what comes out of my head.So, take care, have a good evening, weekend or what -- wherever you're at. Take care.","Low","Low","Low"

"VLOG63","Hey debris . How you freaking doing, eh? I haven't a vlogged in a long time. Mostly I'm trying to entertain your asses with some kind of stupid -- stupid act, but I thought, you know what, let me be real for one time. Well, not for once, because really me trying to entertain you, but, I see that it really doesn't have much effect, you know, even when I did the little and got over two hundred views. No new subscribers so I, you know, whatever. I'm just going to do what I do and we'll see what happens, you know what I'm saying?That's right. Mary Posta's having a beer, chilling out after a long day at work. Actually, it's pretty late right now. I'm going to be going to bed in a little while, but I wanted to get that vlog out to a few people out there. My public, my adoring fans, all fifteen of you. Yeah, you know what? Something really cool freaking happened to me after I got home from work. Um, I drive up, uh, behind my house and I'm walking up the stairs and I see this helicopter, kinda like circling around, you know, and flying around, and I thought, wow that's a pretty cool looking helicopter. And uh, it was one of those jet copters, you know. And uh -- eh, I didn't think much about it. It was all really high up in the air, and I go into my house and, you know, drop my keys and change into some shorts and a t shirt and you know get out of the office clothes.And I put on the TV and I start watching some Seinfeld and all of a sudden a really loud sound of the helicopter. I can tell it's like overhead, it's over the -- over, excuse me, over the house. I'm like, whoa, that's pretty -- flying pretty low, isn't it? And so I kinda look out my front bay window, in the front here. And all of a sudden I can see that the leaves and the trees are rustling and all that, and the wind is blowing everywhere. And right in front of my house, this helicopter is landing in the street right in front of my freaking house.How many times in your life have you ever seen a helicopter land exactly in front of your house? And I -- I see it's uh the Broward County Sheriff's, uh, department helicopter. And it's funny -- you know, it's not like I did anything. You know, I don't have a record, I don't have any outstanding warrants, but when I saw that, I'm think-- I still had this feeling like they were coming for me, like, did I do something? Why the hell are they landing under my house? You know, then I'm like, no, no. Of course, you know, I blew that off real fast, but it was funny that I had that initial reaction, like, oh shit, you know, they're coming for me. And so this freaking helicopter lands in front of my house. And I'm like, what the hell are they doing? And I see the -- like, I walk up to the front of my window and I'm standing there with this confused look on my face, and I see the pilot look over at me and then, like, you know, finish, like, doing his landing. And I'm like, shit, you know , what's going on here?And uh, so uh doors open and this guy gets out from the side and he goes over to the back and opens up some doors in the back and he pulls out this, like, hospital gurney like what they have for ambulances and everything. I'm like, oh, something must be going on, like, next door or in the neighborhood. So I open the door and I come outside and I look around to the side and then I see, a little bit further down, a bunch of cars and an ambulance and all the stuff over there off to the side. And I'm like, uh okay, maybe , like there were less trees or something. And you know, like that was the best landing spot. But then he took, like, you know, the medical stuff over there to like where the paramedics were.But, yeah, the whole neighborhood was out there, watching what was going on. Apparently some -- somebody, you know, had some kind of medical issue. I really don't know what it is. You know, um, I saw the -- the firemen were directing everybody to get away from the area, and instead of crowding around. So I didn't want to be a jerk and go out there, what is going on? I gotta know. We didn't do it, who got hurt? I gotta know everything; I'm a nosy body, you know.Yeah, so I didn't want to be like that. So you know, I'm minding my own business. You know, somebody got hurt, they're going to the hospital, that's all I gotta to know, right? So they put some lady in the back, it looked like a lady, into the back of the helicopter. The helicopter flew away. And it had to be serious if they called in a helicopter so I said a little prayer for the person. I hope they're doing okay. And uh that was the big excitement when I got home today from work.And occasionally I slip into my accent because like I got family from the South on my Mama's side, you know, other times you'll hear me have a little street accent; you know, I did a little soul. That's cause I grew up in Chicago. And then you know, occasionally I like do a little, you know, thing, you know, my background in Chicago, you know. But anyway. So what was I talkn' about? Oh yeah, so the helicopter. Woo hoo. Yeah, I know, maybe it's not that an exciting story but how many of you could've claimed to have a helicopter land in front of your house, huh?You know, another thing I wanted to talk about was anti American sentiment on YouTube. I saw this one video in a clip or at -- actually you know the comedian, Sacha Baron Cohen and he was in an interview with Conan O'Brien on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien show, and he was doing the whole interview as the Borat character. And I didn't see the movie because, honestly, that kinda humor is a little over the top for me. And I get -- I get seriously nervous when I watch somebody be that outlandish, especially with people who don't know what's going on. Um, and so I've been putting off watching the movie, even though I'm sure it's going to be funny when I get around to seeing it. But anyway, the point is I saw this clip on tube of this interview and I put a quote in there -- a comment was -- which said, I'm curious to know if any Arabs find Sacha Baron Cohen's characterization offensive? Because I , but I saw Borat doing the voice. You know, he's telling people he's from, you know, whatever country he's from. I thought he was imitating an Arabic guy, um then somebody replies in the comment calling me, you know, you stupid American, stupid fucking stupid American, and you know -- Borat is not Arab um, you know, learn your fucking geography and you know, but I don't blame you because, you know, you're an American. And you know, some -- all this anti American rage which just got thrown at me. But the thing was, maybe I'm wrong, okay, and the character is not supposed to be an Arab, okay. Whatever ethnic background he's supposed to be. I thought he was imitating an Arab and I thought, you know what, maybe, you know, some Arabs wouldn't like this guy and would feel bad when they saw this, saw them making fun of him. I was trying to be nice, say, you know, I'm curious. Do you find that offensive? Does that make you mad when you see that, you know? I'm trying to be racially sensitive to people out there or ethnically sensitive or whatever the hell it is. I'm just trying to be, you know, uh, sensitive to the feelings of other people out there, my fellow brothers and sisters. And then I get this kind of hatred, this rage back for my trouble. And this isn't the first time that I've encountered this kinda comments or seen those kinda comments on the internet and I gotta wonder, you know, why -I've talked about this before in a previous video, even though I erased the video before. Why is there so much hatred, against America and Americans, from other countries? You know, uh a lot of times they claim that we're ignorant about their culture or the things that they're doing, but I gotta tell ya, I've talked to foreign through the internet, and a lot of them know just about jack about the United States as well . All they know about the United States is from what they see in movies and TV, and you know as well as I do that most of that","High","Low","Low"
"VLOG64","Good morning everybody, it's Sunday morning and my days on me.That's what that is.Good afternoon.We are driving to Paris, or actually it Lecher near Paris, eh, you guys know we're going to I XXXX Juvelance Christmas Jam, which is a specific beat, a specific type of BMX freestyle. It's, um, it's a rider, a small freestyle BMX bike, and the flat surface is like break dancing on a small bike, you'll see.It's just a bike.I thought you said there's a bike in the back.That's my camera bag and all the stuff. This is food and drinks, very important, and eh, this is my buddy's car, he's driving of course. This is his -- is his car.And we've got two hours and twenty five minutes to go before we reach our destination, and this is France, we just crossed the border into France eh, that means we've been through Belgium and um, we've been driving now for about -- how long we've been driving?Almost two hours.Almost two hours so, eh, the weather is great we got some sun and it's dry and, so that makes good weather conditions for driving, yup.So I was just saying to my face that all though it's two hours away France is extremely different from the Netherlands, so is Belgium by the way, and it's very close to where we live.I think the whole culture and the way the people live, and listening to the navigation system and talking get to the wrong lane or something so, uh, yes completely different to the Netherlands, um, especially the buildings and the way the infrastructure is, but you know also the people itself . Could I live in France? I don't know, I could live everywhere, I just, you know, adapt to my surroundings, but, I think I like the Netherlands better.How about you XXXX, could you live in France?Je ne sais pas.That's French for I don't know. I will teach you guys French words. So, hello is -- um, it's -- can bebon jour, which is hello. But I know, I learned that only tourists say that. But French people, when they greet each other they say salut. So yeah, salut.Croissant.Croissant. You know croissant, guys? Yeah, you know croissant. Anyway, parapluie, he he.Anyway, we'll see we're driving on the highway, uh, maximum speed on the highway is the same as the Netherlands, I think, a hundred and twenty kilometers per hour.Did I tell you I like this car. XXXX is alo -- already over there. And it was kinda disappointing that they didn't ride so much it was more like, um, you know, just doing, having some fun together and teaching or showing the little kids that, you know, are in XXXX Juevelance's Flatlands corps. You know, what Flatland is and, you know it was in a jam like a regular jam where they do like pretty hard tricks and links and stuff. So, it was too bad. It was good to see XXXX and XXXX again and all the French riders, and good, you know, to get back into the scene like this, like a contest on a small scale. So I'm going to go home now, it's five o'clock. Hopefully we will be home at around eleven o'clock.Maybe, we'll see. Where's our car?So, we are driving home and now its five o'clock and this computer says it will take four hours and fifteen minutes to get home so that'll actually means we'll get home, uh, early, early, early. So uh, um, yeah, we're rid -- we're driving to Lecher, this small town where the jam was and, you know, kinda disappointed that you know that, you know, it wasn't any hard core riding being done, but you know, it was good to see XXXX and XXXX and you know. So they know, you know, I'm back in business.And our little XXXX was wearing his hat and we're going home and stop -- you know stop somewhere to get a bite to eat. Right, XXXX?At the Mac.The McDonald's, of course. Yeah, we're having fun. Yup, we're going to get some dinner over here at the restaurant. Hopefully, it will be good and edible, which is not always the case here in France. So we're waiting in line here, it's not like , but you know it's food. So we were looking at the food over there and we were thinking like, that's like, that's like really gross, so not going to do that.Probably get a sandwich or something hopefully, maybe, we'll see a McDonald's on the way cause it's unbelievable we've been driving for almost like two hours or something an hour in a half, no McDonald's.No, one McDonald's.Yeah, one McDonald's, you know, we saw that one when we were like passed -- when we passed it, so pretty stupid. So, um, yeah we'll probably get a sandwich or something cause the food over there is really gross. And finally we found a McDonald's. Yeah.As you can see guys, I'm back home again that's right, and it was a long day and a timing day especially for XXXX who did all the driving four and hal -- four and a half hours to go there, four and a half hours to come back. I know you guys in US and Canada are used to driving long stretches like this, but for us in Europe it's a really long drive. Anyway, we had a lot of fun, eh, um, I had a lot of fun, XXXX had a lot of fun um, yeah, it just a cool thing to go on a road trip again. Me and XXXX we used to go like contest together, um you know. We would hang out for a weekend somewhere, someplace, some city and, you know, dinner and fun and stuff like that so that I'm glad that we, uh, did it again. And hopefully, we'll do it more often. We're planning to do it more often so that's really cool. Um, you want to see any Flatland riding in this video guys, um, that's the way I'll -- I'll -- I'm going to do it with all the, uh you know, places I go to regarding BMX Flatland. Um, you'll see a small impression of the Flatlands riding being done if you click on this link. It'll go to my other channel, my special projects channel. And this channel will be just for, you know, the video di -- video diary, the road trip in itself, traveling, you know, me, flogging. So, uh, when it comes to like filming material for XXXX in my video magazine it was a, uh, a bad day, it was a huge disappointment actually, um, because there wasn't any real hard core or flatland riding being done. It was just more about XXXX , um you know, he has this place to himself, it's like his trading spot, and like he's giving back to the -- his community by he has flatland school where he teaches young kids, so it was more about riders getting together, you know, for the kids, you know, doing some small, you know, stuff for the kids, some, some riding, some relaxed riding for the kids there. So, it wasn't really like hard core riding that I want for my flatland video magazine. So, in ca -- in terms of, uh, filming material for XXXX was a bad day but in, um, when talking about, um, the first event for me to go on re launch XXXX, to get back into the flatland scene again, is -- it was a good day. Um, I had the opportunity to talk to XXXX and XXXX in a relaxed atmosphere, um, we talked about XXXX and flatland in general and where it's going and you know. So yeah, everybody's enthu -- enthusiastic about XXXX getting back in flatland TV so that's good. But anyway, I'm going to leave you guys with a Reinato quiz question for today which is. My friend XXXX is not from the city Helmond, where I come from, where I live in, so what city is XXXX from? Okay, so if you don't know the answer to that question you should check out Thursday's video which is called an Alien Spaceship has Landed and you'll find the answer in there. I'm going to go to bed now and I'll see you guystomo","High","High","High"
"VLOG65","Since our internet connection has once more decided to suck again today, I thought I could just make a video instead of watching them.Okay, the best thing that happened was that somebody I know or knew found my YouTube channel. That has happened before, and well, that's okay, he wrote me a nice message and yeah. The thing is that I last saw him, about, almost ten years ago. And he wrote me a message and said that he didn't recognize me at first because I looked different.Well, okay, it's been ten years. You never really notice that you change, yourself. The same week, I found this channel, Project Class Reunion, by Sarah Olzaga and she is planning to lose a certain amount of weight for her ten year class reunion. So, I'd also have my ten year class reunion this year. I don't know if there's going to be anything and I don't know if I can attend because I don't live that close to my parents anymore, but it got me thinking, because ten years is a long time and people change.And the question is when you just meet like, about thirty or forty people, what's the important thing? Is it what you achieved or what you are now? Like, what am I? I live in Berlin. I am an architect. I work in a somewhat fancy architectural office. I don't have children. I'm not married, but I live with my boyfriend for a few years. Would that be my profile? Would that be me, and how much would it say about me? Or tell about the person I am?So, yeah, that, that just got me thinking, who am I if I just meet someone I haven't seen for ten years. It's just like, what are you doing? Who are you now? Just, could you answer that and would it just tell anything about the person you are; not only facts, like job, kids, married stuff?Oh, another short thing, there's going to be this YouTube secret talent award show in ten days and that's going to be great, because it's here in Berlin and there are several people, YouTubers, coming here and I'm really looking forward to that, because it's kind of cool. I hope so. And yeah, the watcho , I don't know what to expect about that, it's just -- the interesting thing is just to meet people and have fun together and yeah, I'm really looking forward to that. So I'll see you or you'll see me in person or video or something. Bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG66","Hi, everyone. Um, it's XXXX and this is XXXX.Um, last week I did the um, cooking video, so that was week four; I just didn't label it. But anyways, I'm glad, like, a lot of people liked that and, um, I got a couple of messages saying that they've tried it and stuff, and that it was great, and so that's, that's awesome.Um, I kind of have some bad news. This week, well today, is Thursday and it's my weighed in day and so, I woke up, went to the bathroom and stepped on the scale and I have gained one pound. Now, I know it's just one pound, but I was really hoping to lose, like two, but I guess in the big scheme of everything, what's one pound?Compared to, like, fifty? Not, not a lot, I guess, but still, it's kind of disheartening, but it, it's motivated me, because I do really well. But, like, I do well during the day, I do like, perfect, okay?But then, um, at night, I stay up really late and I need to not, because I eat. I get hungry, it's horrible. So, I'll work on that, because I don't want to waste time doing well during the day if I'm going to just ruin it all at night, so I really need to work hard, um, yeah.So this morning I decided to make a green smoothie, which I make a lot, okay, but I didn't want to use milk just because I drink too much milk at night. Anyways, so I had some carrot juice left over from some soup that I had made. So I tried to put carrot juice in my shake, um, you know, it just looks like that, just normal.Anyways, I'm going to try it, because I don't really know if it will be good, or bad, or what. Um, it's pretty good. I mean, it just tastes like it does with milk, but, like, I guess you get kind of a carrot aftertaste.Um, I think it's a great alternative, and way less calories, and uh, lots of vitamin A, so good to that.So what went in to the blender was, one banana, a third of a cup of carrot juice, three fourths cup of yoghurt or one like, packet thingy, like five ice cubes, and a handful of spinach. It's pretty good.Okay, so I weigh myself a lot. Well, not so much anymore, but I used to. I used to weigh myself like five times, every day. And if you think I'm kidding you, I'm not.Um, so I decided to do a little mathematical equation to figure out how much time that really is. So what I did was, I just pretended like I weighed myself once a day, for my whole life, okay? Eighty five years, I'm gonna say is how long I'm gonna live.Um, so, if I weighed myself, guessing that it would take one minute to do, every day of my life for eighty five years, I would waste five hundred and seventeen hours. Five hundred seventeen hours; that's such a long time to be just weighing yourself.Um, weighing yourself is such a petty thing to do anyways because, I gained one pound this week, but can I tell that I gained one pound this week? No. And, if I had lost one pound, could I tell? Probably not.Um, what I should be doing is just measuring my waist once a month, 'cause that is real progress. A number on the scales isn't as important as -- it's not worth those five hundred and seventeen hours.So I know that's a little unrealistic, to weigh yourself everyday for 85 years. So I said okay, I'll do this for thirty years. Alright, if you weigh yourself once a day for thirty years, you're wasting a hundred eighty two hours.Okay, let's say you're doing it for just ten years. You're dieting for just ten years, and you're weighing yourself everyday, that's sixty hours. That's sixty days that you could be exercising for an hour a day and you could be losing real weight instead of weighing yourself all the time.Okay, I weigh myself once a week now, and it's really hard to stay off the scale, because, um, last summer is when I really started wanting to lose weight, and I didn't do it in a healthy way. I restricted my calories, and I didn't eat enough.Um, I lost twenty pounds that summer. So I wouldn't say I was like, majorly restricting, but it definitely was not good, at all. So then, by that school year, I'm like, whoa, I need to cool it, you know? I need to eat healthy again. But I didn't, still.Now, I started to over eat because, I really don't know why, but I just, I started to eat way too much, so throughout the school year, I gained -- this school year that's over now -- I gained like, 40 pounds back.That's like, -- now I have to loose that much just to get to where I was. It's horrible. It's a horrible thing to have to go through, and -So now I'm eating healthy and I'm loving it. I'm a lot happier. I'm getting my personality back. Um, huh, yeah, and I'm just learning to love life again.But I won't ever really be happy with what I weigh, until I weigh -- until I get those forty pounds off, 'cause I just wish I hadn't have done that. Because if I knew what I knew now, I -- I could've lost so much weight, healthy, and I could have kept it off.But you know, I'm young, I have a life ahead of me, so I really don't have anything to worry about. Um, yeaAnyway, sorry this was like, end of a -- I don't know, depressing video, but I'm focusing on getting things better -- I get way too many thumbs up.Anyways, um, so, comment, subscribe.I will talk to you all next week with a more positive message, I'm determined and, um, goodbye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG67","Oh my God. It's actually been forever since I've sat down here. And lot. It's been too long. I'm sorry guys.I suppose you need an -- better explanation to why I stopped doing the daily blogs, yeah? Well, basically I'm starting college next week some time. And I just won't have time to make these every day anymore. And, like, I started these in the summer so I had a lot of free time, but just things keep getting on top of me and I keep falling really behind with these. And I think it might've been silly of me to the daily thing 'cause I just know I don't have time.That's why I decided to make them weekly more or less. Or, you know, just when I can. So, like, so you might see two or three a week, but not one every day. So won't fall behind at least. So -- yeah. Sorry about that. And I know I'm giving up for whatever, but it's only a daily blog; it's not a big deal, is it?But I'm keeping this channel as my blog channel and I still have my other channel which I'm gonna work on 'cause it's been, like, months since I've done anything on it. I uploaded a video there the other day, so link in the sidebar side if you haven't seen it already.I'm happy. I went to town today and look what I got. New off the cover Kelly book. And, if you don't know those books, they're brilliant. They're so funny.You're also probably wondering, are these, like, gaps in my fringe? No, I've got blond in my fringe now -- got blond in my hair now. Um, basically I got my hair cut a little while ago and -- you know -- I thought when I was coming out -- ah, it's great, it's really short. Cool; won't grow back as fast. But then I got home and I was, like, whoa it's really short!And I thought, like, I wanted to get my hair dyed anyhow and I thought my natural hair color was a bit too boring so I wanted to dye it black anyway. But Aneed did this for me -- Aneed, links in the sidebar. Um, I think she did a pretty good damn job, don't you? I like the blond, it's different. And it's sort of Irish; help put colors in it or something. I don't know. Maybe some green or pink or something. Or something. Or I'll just dye it black. I don't know. I'll see -- I'll see how it goes. Yeah.How are you guys? It's been forever. I'm a little bit obsessed with this song -- Florence and the Machine -- Dog Days. Probably 'cause I watched so much Skins -- but it's a good song.Oh -- also -- I have to tell you guys this. I've started putting stuff up in my room on the walls. Check this out, right? Boom! A single poster. Um, it's just a landscape of New York. But still it's something, right? So I -- I've got another one over here -- hold on. Room's bit of a mess. See it up there above the mirror? Yeah. Also got some stuff going on here. And over here. 'Cause this is my work area so I put stuff up around it. This is my desk and stuff. So I need to get more posters for the walls 'cause as you can see, they are still quite blank and I'm thinking a bit of Audrey Hepburn, a bit more New York, something like that. I don't know.So guys, I'll talk to you later but leave me comments and so -- do you like my hair? Also, what type of posters should I put in my room? Hmm? Should I put anything in particular up? Also, how've you guys been? It's been forever, right? I know. So check all the links in the sidebar and all that usual stuff.And I should talk to you guys later. Bye.","Low","Low","Low"
"VLOG68","This is basically the best early birthday present I've ever received, and later on I'll give you a full view of the costume.Sorry about the weird, um, positioning of this camera. It's just that this is the only place with good, good, lighting and my camera's charging so it needs to be hooked up to the thing which is over there, and it can't be in the normal place; you get the idea.If you didn't know, I'm on school holidays and to start off the holidays me and my friend, Olivia, went to a four hour Hero concert, which was so awesome and we met the band, so here are some pictures now.This is making me look like I am a Goth, so I think I'll take this off, just for now.Me and my friend, Dylan, have been a massive fan of community channels videos for a very long time. So when she tweeted that she was going to be in Melbourne, we kind of had to react. Um, so we tweeted her, kept on asking where she was going to be. She finally said she would be in Chapel Street, in Fitzroy.So we went to Chapel Street, and we're searching for her for about two hours, just going up and down the street, and then finally, um, we saw her with her friend Sar , who was doing her FBI warning video, and they were both so nice to us.They, um, took us out for lunch, and it was such a good day, really nice people. She even mentioned me and Dylan in one of her videos, called XXXX. You can check it out on the sidebar, and if you're not subscribed to XXXX, I highly recommend you subscribe.St Kilda are number one on the ladder, which makes me so happy because we've been playing so well.Um, in fact, this week, I'm going to the footie with one of my friends, so that's going to be exciting, um, especially, 'cause I haven't seen him in a really long time. Yeah.In two days it's going to be my birthday, which is on a Friday, and I'm so excited because I'm gonna be getting a ukulele that I picked out from the music shop with my Mum. And it's such a lovely ukulele and I'm really excited, and yay!I have tickets to see All Time Low and Short Stack, so I'm very excited for that and hopefully soon, I'll be getting tickets to see Pink.Last week I went with my family and we saw Billy Elliot, and I got this t shirt. Billy Elliot, The Musical, by the way. And I have to say, it was really good, I really liked it, but it doesn't really compare to the movie. Um, I just think that the movie was brilliant and, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.One thing I particularly didn't like, was that Billy was, in the musical, he was really technical and he was so good, but I liked that part of the movie, how Billy wasn't technical and he was, kind of, just danced how he felt. Like, in the musical, he was doing, like, perfect developpes to second and, you know what I mean?It was Brendon Urie's birthday on April twelfth, as you may have known since I posted a video dedicated to him. And I found out the next day that he had a girlfriend, and grrr that makes me, just, quite jealous actually, because I love Brendon Urie a lot.As you may or may not know, I hate this particular girl called XXXX So I typed in on YouTube hate XXXX to see if anyone else had the same opinion as me. And this one guy did and he made an excellent video that you should check out in the sidebar. I just, I couldn't stop laughing for about half an hour.Before I leave you, I just want to say sorry for not posting a blog in a very long time, and I also want to say hello to Luellen's brother and sister, Tish and Lennon , hello.You so wish you had this costume.","High","High","Low"

I'm pretty sure you should like, 'cause it's awesome.And speaking of awesome, my snowboarding, this weekend will not be awesome and I might die, so if the blogging stops abruptly, you'll know why.

"VLOG7","Hey you guys, um, I decided for this video I would be holding a Christmas ball. I just took it off my tree because it broke and, um, it's kinda plastic, a bit stupid, but I just thought since Christmas is coming up soon, that I'd, you know, my video that's, uh -- that's my attempt.All right, let's start off this with, um, a little recap. Um, I haven't made a video, um, in a while, so I guess this is time to you just talk a bit more about what happened last week and the week before last, and my views on it.Sadly, a lot of really good acts have actually been booted off X Factor, um, names such as Lucie Jones; Lloyd Daniels; add Danyl Johnson; all really good contestants, but I don't really think they made the cut. And the finalists now are the ones who really deserve to be in there, and are the ones that are definitely the best. But I was still very sad to see those three go. Um, when I found out that John and Edward, , um, were kicked off, I was really happy, because every second when I saw them perform, I died a little inside. Isn't that sad?Last week, after watching Lady Gaga perform Bad Romance in her awesome devil costume and starting off in a bath that apparently was from Simon Cowell, I, uh, placed my vote for Oli. I am about to place my vote this week for Oli Myers.Thank you for calling The X Factor. and be with you.Woow! Go Myers! All right, let's talk a little bit about this week, because that's probably the most important thing at the moment. Um, I sadly don't have my TV yet. Um, actually, . That's for my TV when it comes. It should have come a couple of weeks ago, but it still hasn't come. Damn. Can't wait.And, um, this is my tree and our stockings -- and I kinda went off the point, but anyway. Um, yeah. So basically, uh, I watched a couple of performances on the ITV Channel Four for X Factor, and, um, I was really disappointed. Last week was amazing. All the acts did brilliantly; they sang really well; I was -- wanted them all to stay in, 'cause they all did so fabulously. But this time it was terrible. They did just terrible. So, yeah, Stacey was kicked out, big deal -- she did terrible. I liked her -- her first audition and she went downhill from there. She just wasn't that great. I don't like her personality. It's too corky and funny and cute and really, really hyper. It's like she's always, constantly fueled with coffee and caffeine and whatever other stimulants I could -- I could think off, but I can't. Anyway, it's like she had a tube in her puffing , and she's always so hyper it pissed me off. So I'm so glad she got kicked off. Um, but yeah, I think Oli's going to win, I'm sorry. Both Oli and Joe have got a lot of support. However, Joe is younger, less experienced, while Oli's older, smarter, cooler, better and just way more appealing than any of the other competitors since the whole show started. Um, so I'm really hoping he wins.All right, now it's your time to get video responding and commenting on this video. Please tell me what you think, um, about this week's, uh, shows, last week's shows, whatever. Who you want to see win the X Factor and who do you think, um, would be, like, the best record producing artist out of all the expected contestants. Because already, Lucie Jones and Lloyd Daniels and John and Edward have already -- still are pretty famous, even though they already got kicked off, which was, um, inevitable, because liked them.Anway --","High","High","Low"

"VLOG71","Ay caramba, yow , ditiling , that one, no, um, so I don't usually do this. I'm not much of a blogger. I don't blog at all, but I want to talk about this because, uh, I can do whatever I want with the camera. Seriously, ah, Marge Simpson from the Simpsons TV show, twenty years on the air, last night shouldn't count, um, is going to be on the cover of Playboy magazine and she's going to be nude or quote very, very racy inside the magazine. This blows my mind for several reasons. First of all, have we slipped into some sort of parallel dimension called Japan where cartoon pornography reigns supreme? Or just what's going on over Playboy? Like they really -- they ran out of human girls? Like, we're not -- when I crack open a Playboy magazine which doesn't happen often, 'cause now I have the internet. Um, I don't -- I don't usually want to see cartoons naked, I -- I don't know. Maybe -- maybe I'm weird. Maybe -- maybe I'm old fashioned but I like a nice set of human jugs and a nice human butt. Uh, yellow skin freaks me out. That's not a knock on agent. Um, but I -- first of all, if we're going by popular female cartoon characters right now, I'd think Lowen -- Lois -- Lowen -- I think Lois Griffin's more appealing, I don't know. Maybe I have a thing for red heads. Maybe I want to see Alex Borstein naked, although she's kind of round. But that's another story. Look the bottom line is -- is, several other cartoon, uh, female cartoon characters, I'd rather see nude. Number one on that list is Cheetara from Thunder Cats. Although, I'm pretty sure I can imagine what that would look like and that sort of an animal thing and the getting the beastiality -- all right so no on Cheetara. Um, what about Teela from the He man series? Huh? Little -- Little kids out there? All my -- da, viewers under the age of thirty? He man? Teela? No? Anybody? How about Jane Jetson? How about that, Jane Jetson the little Flintstones in penthouse doing some sort of lesbo thing? Although I hear -- I hear they both aged horribly, lot of wrinkles and sagging so we'll scrap that idea.But the bottom line is, I know Hugh hefner's old. I know he's getting to the point where he's -- how do you say, bat shit crazy. I know that he has his life filmed; that he make believes that he's sleeping with twins now and all that jazz but at what point is he like, you know what else, like let's have a naked cow on Playboy? Let's -- let's die her up nice and let's put her right in there - give her a pictorial. Who doesn't love milk right? Am I right guys? It's the twentieth anniversary of milk, they're like, oh, oh, he's lost his shit. No, nobody knows what's wrong.So I -- I -- I want -- I want your opinion on this. Ah, first of all do you want me to do any bloggy stuff like this anymore? Probably not? Um, are -- secondly are you going to buy it? I mean is the internet kind of killed Playboy out of the whole, like -- like the uniqueness of it, like when a celebrity does Playboy? It's like who gives a shit, let's go on the internet the next day and find the photos that somebody's scanned in. I'm like whatever. I'm like -- are you guys , girls?Do you want to start seeing male cartoon characters, uh, nude anywhere? I don't know is cartoon porn like a big thing? Am I -- am I missing out on this? Like, dude you're not watching cartoon porn? Ooh, how gay are you on a scale of one to queer? I'm like I don't know, you tell me. Um, so yeah, video, respond, comment, let me know your thoughts on this. I really want to get a collective opinion of how behind the times I am or how, you know, right I am that this is kind of creepy and weird and no one's really going to buy it and it's not that special. Let me know. .","High","High","Low"
"VLOG72","Okay. Hey guys, what's up? This is XXXX. I'm in the car. I got the night vision on, sorry about that. But hey, this is a message to my young high school listeners and even some of the kids that are just starting into college. Here is my advice to you about college. I have a four year degree. I went to the UC system. I got a Political Science Degree and here's my advice to you. Don't go to college. College is utterly, utterly worthless. Don't hurt your parents. If you're begging off your parents, sucking money off the teeth of your mom and dad to pay for your worthless schooling, don't do it. Don't hurt your mom and dad. They may not have a pension left after that.Number two, get a skill that is in demand. Look around. Look at your mom, look at your dad, look what they do for a living. Look at your uncles, look at your aunts, see what they're doing to make a living and then go get that skill set. Most of the time you can get that without going to college. Just realize you're in a whole different environment right now. If you go to college thinking you're going to get some bullshit English Degree and you're gonna become a teacher or you're gonna become like some type of, uh, you know, BA in Business and you're going to get into middle management and make a hundred thousand dollars a year in your first two or three years. This is your wakeup call. This is -- I'm an adult talking to you. Unless you're gonna go and become like a doctor or, you know, maybe like a biochemist. You know, even Biochemists are having trouble getting jobs.You know, don't think that you can just keep going to more and more schooling to get a job. The economy is changing. There may not be a job out there for you. Get a skill. And first do your research. Okay, I didn't do this, I'm giving you advice. Okay? Do your research on what actually is paying money right now and then go to school and get that. Or better yet, just go out and do the job. Go out and intern, you know, go work for free if you have to but get the skills necessary to make the money. What I'm tired of is nineteen year old, twenty one year old kids in calls as I talk to you and you guys sound like fuck. I mean it's like I try to put reality into your face and you guys can't even accept it. You're in some sort of la la land and you have no idea what's going on. I've been there, I've done that, you've got to listen to me. If you aim to be like an investment banker, you better hope mom and dad have tons of connections. Unless you got a shitload of connections to get you into some business level corporate type of piss on job or whatever, you're not going to get it through the normal progress. College is over rated. Everybody has a degree. I went for four years, I didn't need to go to four years. Going to a little room with a bunch of dumb ass kids to listen to some professor that probably doesn't know what the fuck he is talking about isn't the way to learn anymore. The way to learn now is to Google it. Whatever you need to know you can type into Google and spend twenty hours learning and teaching yourself or going out -- if it's a real skill -- going out and learn it yourself on the job. Go earn some money. Don't waste time in college. Think about what you can do that can go earn you money. Even if the pay is low, you're going to get valuable, valuable experience by just working on a job. Working on a job is way more -- working is ten times better than going to an artificial university setting and learning a bunch of stuff that doesn't apply to the real world. So that's my advice to you. Get on the Internet. Go out in the real world. Do real things. Realize when you paying ten, twenty, thirty, forty thousand dollars a year for a university education.That will be the last thing I have to say is if you're eighteen, grow the fuck up. Just grow up. You're not a little baby anymore, you're a woman, you're a man. Take responsibility for yourself and go out and work. Do anything. I mean, you don't even have to work. Just don't -- I mean go out and be a Beatnik and travel the country, you know, hitchhiking. You're going to learn more doing that then going to some little artificial university where someone's going to babysit you in some classroom. Just grow up, okay? Your parents have ruined this county and they're babying the crap out of you. It's time your generation stands up and says fuck you to college. You know at college. You don't need that, you have the internet. Anything that you can be taught in college you can be taught via the internet. So this is your wake up call. George Sotato to my younger listeners, don't go to college, it's a worthless investment and you won't have all the debt that you have to pay back. Take care, peace out, down with college, up with learning and getting real world experience. Peace.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG73","﻿Hello Youtube. I know I haven't made a video in a while and I keep meaning to, but, um, I'm a procrastinator, that's what I do. Um, but this is kind of a response to community channel. A couple of videos ago, the one she made about, um, irrational fears and your secret escape plan, because I've been thinking about this for a lot early, way before she made the video and I pretty much know exactly what my escape plan would be, but first let's talk about my fear. I have an irrational fear of, um, people hiding in dark spaces at night in my room. Um, which doesn't sound that irrational, but pretty much every night I do the same thing. I turn off all the lights in my room, whatever and I'm about to go to bed. Except for that -- at night I check my email. That's when I go on Youtube, watch videos whatever. So all the lights in my room are off and then I just have my computer screen going and I stare at it for a while, so everything around me is dark and then when I close my computer screen and put that away, I still can't really see very well, 'cause, um, the light has been so bright in my face so I can't see. And then I normally curl up into the fetal position and start thinking about the fact that there's got to be people in my room somewhere, hiding. They're about to attack me. Normal places are -- there's a corner over there that, um, is dark and there's my closet which is back over there, uh, which is very small and dark and scary at night and I get to thinking that there have to be people in there and I'm always in the fetal position away from my closet looking in the other corner so I can't see those two places. Um, and I just keep on telling myself, there's no one there, there can't be anyone there, I've been there the whole time. Like I know the light was on in my face and someone could have snuck in because I couldn't see around me anyways, but there's no one in there and I kind of just like put it at bay and start thinking about something else. But then a couple of minutes later, I'm freaked out again and I'm just thinking I've been lying in this one position, like, what if someone snuck in behind me and they're hiding in my closet and they're about to pop up and they're just like, um, and like, attack me. So my initial plan a long time ago, was just kind of like, if they came up from behind which was how it always in my head works, I full bang them, I like smack their face and then I scream as loud as possible because my parents are only a few rooms down. And that was the whole plan, but lately I've been thinking about it again and I have weapons now. So the new plan is to smack in the face and scream and then rather like mend in their nose or whatever I did to them because I'm super strong in this dream, yes. Can't you tell how strong I am? Um, I reach down and I pick up the knitting needle, because I always leave knitting needles near my bed now because I knit a lot. This is not just like because of this fear, I do knit a lot. But heavy nails, this is my favorite because it's metal and it's sharp and it's thin and I could just turn around and just stab somewhere, like you said, probably in the eye because that would be the most time consuming place and then, I normally keep this over my door, but I just got it so I can show you and then I got the newest part of the plan because I just got this not long ago from some of friends. We were in China Town and they bought me a samurai sword - here, I'll take off the sheath. It's like actually sharp. It's like a sharpened samurai sword so I get up while they're mending their eye which I just stabbed with a knitting needle. Ooh, there we go. Um, and I run for the sword and then I'm holding them there with the sword like, what you going to do now? I have a sword in your face. Bam. Yeah, but that's my plan. There's this sick little part of me though that really wants it to happen. Like as scary as that would be, is it weird that there's part of me in myself that's like I want to try out my plan? I want to. Um, I'll make another video soon because I have other stuff to talk about other than how I'm going to kill an assassin who's hiding in my closet. Okay. Mwah. Bye.","Low","Low","Low"

I, like, I don't know. It's probably going to fall over.Let's talk about what I like because I like things. I like Harry Potter -- a lot, actually. Like, if you look up here, there's a Harry Potter poster. Ron was . I really like Wren . And I do love a lot of musicals, but I'm not very, like, knowledgeable on musicals. I just know that I like a couple of them, and I enjoy them. I'm always open to new suggestions, like musicals.I like a good book. All of the books in here are practically the Twilight series and Harry Potter. Don't -- don't hate me for liking the Twilight series, please. I like it. I don't care if you don't. I mean, we can still be friends. I know people who hate it.And then I also got some, uh, I don't know -- I got Possible Side Effects, by the author who wrote, um, Running With Scissors.

I mean, there's not much in there. But there's a lot over there. See that -- that hamper? Yeah. That's all my clothes. Behind me is my door.Um, and I do love -- now you can't see it. But I really like photography -- especially fashion photography. That's what I hope to go into someday, but you know -- I always got a dream, but when is it really ever going to happen, right?What do I do on YouTube? I watch people such as The FiveAwesomeGays, the FiveAwesomeGirls. Um, I watch, uh -- I definitely watch The Blog Brothers. They are my favorite. I'm quite the Nerdfighter. I even made a shirt; let -- let's see if I can find it. Button it.I was there in Grand Rapids when they had the impromptu Nerdfighter gathering, and I thought, oh no, like ten people would show up, and almost a hundred people did. I was there.If you're wanting to get to know me, you can just message me, or you can comment. There's, like, three comments, so I'll definitely read that and respond to you.

"VLOG76","﻿Hi, it's XXXX, this is XXXX. I just want to check in and let y'all know about my vegan Thanksgiving. It was fantastic. This year I celebrated with a group of people at a potluck -- a vegan potluck. Um, it was a little bit different because in the past whenever I've done a vegan potluck, it's been uh, before Thanksgiving day, and then Thanksgiving day, I celebrate it with my family. My family happens to be vegetarian and vegan, so I've always had a vegetarian or vegan Thanksgiving.So it's not unusual for me to omit the turkey um, and I don't -- I've never felt a need to substitute it. But the last few years uh, because of marriage and other circumstances, there've been a few more omnivores in our family and um, I felt compelled to provide alternative options for them. And also it's just fun to experiment with faux meats. So I did try a tofurkey one year, and uh, again this -- this year we had a tofurkey at our potluck. And it's okay, I think it's just fine. I actually prefer uh, Tofurky brand products uh, that are not the actual tofurkey. I like their sausages and stuff like that, but I don't really like their turkey substitute that they make for Thanksgiving. I prefer instead something called Celebration Roast that's made by a company called Field Roast, so we had that at our table as well.We also had a dish that was like a homemade seitan dish that um, I don't even know who brought it. But it was pretty good um, and that worked as another one of our main dishes. We had just a bunch of main dishes; it was crazy.Um, we also had lots of traditional foods. We had yams and we had um, pumpkin pie, you know and all those kinds of things, which it's very easy to make most of the traditional Thanksgiving side dishes vegan. Or uh, at the very least it's very easy to make them vegetarian, but it's pretty easy to make them vegan. Just substitute stuff like margarine for butter or you use olive oil instead of butter. Um, you know you can soy sour cream, you can get vegan mayonnaise, you can get vegan versions of a lot of, um -- a lot of the products you might use in a lot of your side dishes. Or just try to do it just a little more healthfully and omit a lot of the fatty substances and make it just plain vegetables or just plain beans or something like that.We had a -- speaking of beans, we had a three bean stew that was really good. I love that. Um, that's something that my mom makes and -- and uh, I really liked it. So that was good. Um, what else did we have? We had um, geez, we had so many different things.We had, like, five different desserts. Like I said we had three or four main dishes. We had a whole bunch of sides. I didn't even try everything, and normally in a potluck that's the whole point, right? To try -- at least try everything, take a spoon or a fork from every offering but um, that just wasn't possible. There was too much food -- way too much food. It was really good to celebrate also with other vegans.It's important to reconnect with our community and to know that we're not alone and you know, share ideas and thoughts and experiences. So that was nice to be part of Thanksgiving and that I could give thanks to be part of this wonderful community of people who are so thoughtful and compassionate and um, just good and joyous.So, uh, anyway that was my Thanksgiving. I hope you had a fabulous Thanksgiving and um, take care. Bye.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG77","Hello YouTube. Ah, I was approached by one of my viewers on one of my uh, XXXX videos uh, or because of my XXXX videos to uh, share her story and after reading her story I of course said I would.And uh, given that uh, the comment on this video will be approval pending and the reason behind that is, is I don't feel that there's any argument with it so I'm not going to allow any -- I mean, if you can respectfully argue your point and if you disagree, you know, respectfully, I may actually let those comments be approved. But if I see basically what looks like trolling, they're not going to be approved.Um, the five star ratings will still be allowed, but that will be the extent of it and as you know I have never done this to any of my videos. So obviously I feel very strongly about this subject and I feel that arguing, you know, below the video would simply devalue the story in itself.So I will get started. Um, I also don't know how long this video will be because I am not going to chop any of this story up. I will be reading as it was written to me.I am XXXX. I am prochoice and this is why. Here is my story. When I was sixteen I had a baby. Aborting and adoption was no option for me; my choice. My parents raised me, if you make a mistake own up to it and I did.When my son was six months old, three men came to my door asked for my ex brother in law. At the time we had no screen door or a window to look out of to see who was there. I told him that he wasn't there and they barged in and then two of them raped me. Cops where called, evidence was collected. I was not given any pills as they do today to rape victims. All I got was dressing like that, no wonder, you're just asking for trouble. I was wearing a tube shirt and shorts at the time because it was hot and I had the door and window shut. When I go out in public, I wear a T shirt and jeans and still do to this very day.One month passed and my worst fear became a reality. I was pregnant. Again, abortion and adoption was no option; my choice. I went to my second doctor's visit and he told me that every thing was fine, but it wasn't. The man lied. Now child services got involved when more -- even more and said that I was immature and that my son would be better off without me. So I ran with him and moved to any other city before they could get their hands on him. I know it was wrong, but what other option did I have? Stay there and they take my son or leave and hold on to him.Anyways, living in a new city I though every thing would be better. I got a job, visited the doctor. I thought everything was going great. The second child was born. Two weeks passed after his birth and I new something was wrong with this child. Oh no, everything is fine; your just over reacting. Next visit everything wasn't so fine. He stopped breathing. He was rushed to a children's hospital finding out that he had a vessel from his heart wrapped around his wind pipe. This could be corrected, but there was more. His body temperature was -- his body temperature was below normal, his weight, and he had MS leaving him blind and deaf. Here's the real kicker, always leaving worst for last, he had incurable brain cancer.I knew that there was something wrong because this child never cried, always gasping for air. He never moved or anything. He just laid there. They explained that it was -- it wasn't my fault which I was grateful; at least someone was on my side. I was also told that according to my medical chart the doctor who took care of me knew all about it from the first visit. I confronted him and asked why he lie -- why did he lie to me. His reply, he would have terminated the pregnancy. You're absolutely right, I would have. That poor little boy suffered for eight and a half months. I took him home where he later died.This is why now I have become prochoice. No one, and I mean no one, as the right to with hold information or to tell some one what they can and cannot do because of what they believe in. Prolife people only tell you one side of the story, like someone who had an abortion and regretted it or someone who is raped and is happy they didn't do it. They never tell the story of people like me.If I knew then what I know now, I would have gotten the abortion. A child should never have to suffer that kind of pain. Parents should never have to sit and watch their child suffer, knowing that they had other options and was denied that option.Why didn't I give him up for adoption? Now honestly, would you take a child that you know is going to die or would you take one that was healthy? Besides, I never really like adoptions and don't highly recommend, but I would never tell anyone that they couldn't either. That is totally up to them.I had three sisters that were taken away from my parents just because my dad lost his job and had no money at the time. Child Services did not give my father any time to look for a job -- for a new job before coming in and ripping his children from them. No job, no money, no children. My parents had no choice. Someone made that for them.Thank you for listening to my story. I hope this helps someone in whatever decision they make in life.I'm not going to comment any further, but there is a question that needs to be asked and I'll let this ask it.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG78","﻿Okay, so when you're pregnant, basically, your hormones, like, makes you go certifiably insane.

And then after you have the baby your hormones, like, go crazy again and basically what happens is, um, your hair starts falling out, because your hair doesn't really fall out when you're pregnant, so it just kind of all falls out at once.And well, I was vacuuming the other day and I wondering why the vacuum wasn't really working very well and I tipped it over and you will not believe this, but this is what I cut out of the bottom of the vacuum. Now, you can see that this, like, matches my hair, right? This is disgusting. I, like, shed more than a pet.

First of all, this opening thing here is pretty, pretty cool. We don't have that, and I can't get it open. Brilliant. Ah. There we go. I'm glad first of all they're still in one piece. I had thought they were -- would be crashed to death by, I don't know, travelling the Atlantic, but they're okay, you see. Apparently, apparently that's an Oreo, see? It says here Oreo, which would make a lot of sense. Yeah.I read on the internet -- I went on Wikipedia page to -- to look them up, which is a weird thing to do for cookies, but I did. And I heard that it's a pretty fun thing to pull them apart so let's do it. It works, great. They smell great. Okay, this is it, then. I hope they're good.Ah, I totally know what you guys mean. What the hell? Mm. I was so scared -- I'm just gonna talk with my mouth full because it's funny -- I was so scared that they'd be, you know, not delicious. And I was like, what am I gonna say?

That I'm willing and able to settling there for a few years and feel -- you know -- at home as much as a workplace can get home. So of course it's much better than being unemployed. I finally have a car back and a new cell phone could be's coming Sunday or Monday and -- you know -- all those things. Chatting with people all through the day. I feel like sometimes I -- you know -- talk too much at work after -- I feel like I've been deprived of enough human contact in the last few months. So they -- they say that I -- I feel like I don't -- I can't stop talking and -- it will slow down in a few days or so.Anyway, just wanted to touch base with you people and as I promised once I get a new job I'm gonna blog a lot more so get ready to hear from me -- to hear from me a lot more in the next couple of months and of course not just stopping by to say hello, but taking issues and taking the time to blog about things I care about. And there have been plenty of subjects in the last few weeks to talk about. So I'm getting into gears. Getting back on the horse of blogging is weird. Something that's -- if you only stop doing for a few weeks or months you suddenly feel like you never quit or like you don't really know how to go on but it's like riding a bike. It's gonna get -- uh -- really familiar, really soon. Anyway, thanks for watching. Bye for now.","Low","Low","Low"

"VLOG86","﻿You know what? I think it is entirely reasonable for me to place the blame for my behavior tonight on mee maw and pa paw.I just -- I don't think that they gave me enough attention. I don't think that I've had enough attention as a child, you know? You know, support from them as a child and now I act out as a way of getting attention -- of gaining some kind of parental approval, you know?I just want people to love me, you know? I mean isn't that what we all want? We just want people to love us and that's really, like, I just want people to love me.I wish I had a --a bigger upper lip like my mom. I think it's fine. I just I wish I had a -- yeah, mmm, I need a song!Oh my God. That's like a fucking -- I had an Austin Bright in my head. Like, when I'm taking pictures and stuff like that, like, I can't stay still. Like, if I'm waking for the camera to click off I'm, like, I don't if that's a human person or if it's just some, like, alien person. I really do believe that I'm a alien or a robot or something, one of them. Because like you people, I -- I haven't quite fully learned how to integrate, you know, human cultural cues, into my system, into my program, and you know? It's, like, a foreign language to me that I'm still learning. I haven't fully integrated ever since I was dropped here, you know?Actually, I think that I fell from, like, a shooting star, like, flying across the universe or something like that, and, like, I fell and somehow I landed on your fucking planet, and, like, I just happened to land in a woman's womb and just popped out, like, nine months later, and, like, I'm a fucking alien, so we are not the same.Has anyone stopped to think about just how weird you are as a person? Like, if you -- if you don't think that you're weird, then that's whack. You -- you're pretty whack, and I don't wanna be your friend, because I like weird people. Everybody has their quirks that makes them so weird. Like, people are just weird, like, I don't know if I'm the only one that knows it that people are just weird. I think it's because I notice how weird I am, it probably cues me in how weird other people are. I think that's how it works, sometimes. I'm -- I'm watching my back .What're you doing here? I better stop saying that. A lot of people have been sending me messages on -- since I've been gone. Yes, I have been absent and um, YouTube is not my life, you know? I just have other things to do so, um, get off my Austin nuts all right? Shit. I'll post a video when I want to, damn. That is so rude, but whatever, this is my show, okay? All has been paid for and it's mine.Oh yeah, and this woman, she was like, she was really an older woman and she was hitting on me, and she was, like, you know, you come off a little bit gay in your videos. I don't know if you intend to or not. And, I was, like, well, I am gay. Yeah, I'm gay. Me and the peen, we have an um, long standing relationship, we have a contract, you know?Every now and then. I had to spit, excuse me. It wasn't really spit. I had just ate some, you know, those little pizza roll things that you pop in the microwave and then, like, a minute or two minutes later it pops out, fifteen delicious bites of pizza. Delicious ness, you know what I'm saying? I just had one of those. I had one with, uh, meat. Like meat. Not the kind of meat that I would like to be fucking, there, but you know what, that was inappropriate.So, first of all, I am crazy. So if you think I'm crazy, then it's true. I am crazy. But crazy in a good way, like, crazy in a, you know, I need to be crazy to free myself because I'm a very reserved person. Like, I don't know if you now noticed it, but I'm a very reserved person. I am. And I hate that. It's, like, I have this inner urge to be so exuberating, gregarious, and outgoing, but then I get in those, you know, in an alien situation where I'm around human beings, and it's like I don't understand what people are saying.It's, like, I haven't -- I don't know, I just -- I'm a on my head at one point, and now I can no longer understand how to be a participant in human -- in society and so I observe so I can learn how to fully integrate myself into society. And I don't remember what my original point was, because I just start rambling about, you know, being a freaking alien in human society because I've always felt sometimes, you know?I'm trying to see how long this video is because I'm really not trying to make a long video. I just want to, like, babble and put something on the YouTube just to be, like, yo, I'm still here. I'm working very hard. Um, well, that's a fucking lie. I'm working. Um, I try to write everyday. I do. And I've had some major setbacks even though I've had some brilliant revelations, um, and I'm working on something right now that's put together brilliantly. It is, like, all of the plans that I have for all of the books that I wanted to write are coming together into one book, and it is amazing. It is amazing. And, um, I hope that people will love it when they get it, when I finally, you know, happen to get it into the hands of an agent. And an agent gets it into the hands of a publisher. And then the publisher to an editor. And then the editor actually has it published. I'm -- I'm -- I know it's gonna be amazing. I know it will. And I just -- I'm looking forward for the day when I can walk into a bookstore and see my name on the book, on the shelf. The shelf. And then I'll go on Oprah or Ellen, you know, and the whole audience will get free shit. Damn!But yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't know why I do this. I don't know why I do this. It's, like, late at night when I couldn't -- well, I can't cook right now. I'm currently in my brother's room, okay? Sh, don't tell nobody, but I'm broke. I can't really do anything and it's really heartbreaking when you really want to be out there and -- but you just don't have the money. It -- it breaks my heart to be in the house. I don't like to be in the house. Like, I used to be such a homebody. Ask people who know me, like, a year or two ago, and I was such a homebody. It wasn't, like, I didn't even want to go out to party, but like, I was just, like, well you know, we can, but now it's just, like, yeah, let's fucking party, let's get drunk bitch, let's get drunk. Let's get drunk, aahh, yeah!Um, somebody needs to shave. My dad has massive armpit hair and my mom likes it. I'm just, like, gross, woman. I will never lay in my man's armpit hair. Ugh, and chest hair, I don't wanna see it. Ever. Ever. Okay? I don't wanna see chest hair, I don't wanna feel chest hair, I don't want chest hair. You better wax. Um, I don't know where that came from.So, I have nothing else to say. You better -- I don't know if this looks good on camera but in the mirror, this whole get up, like, it really works for me. I feel like such a -- this is so California right now. You know, I feel -- I'm feeling real California, West Coast in the hizz ouse.Yeah, we're not talking anymore, this is just -- this is just ranting. This is just entertainment for your late night, you know? When you don't have anything to do, turn to me and I'll be here to entertain you. Well, not really to entertain. I don't know if I'm entertaining, but I'll be here to talk about nonsensical shit, you know what I'm saying? That's what I live for, okay? I am here for you, I am.You know Cancer, we are the ultimate hosts on the Zodiac. We are the mother of the Zodiac, okay? We are. We love to nurture, we love to care, we love to hope, we love to be -- you know make everybody feel like part of the family, it's just what we do. So if I can help you in any way feel comfortable, you know, then hey, hey, I've done my job, all right.All right, so I'm signing off right now. So, deuces. Working Monday . You know me.I just watched the video that you just finished watching and I said XXXX -- XXXX, you are -- you are a mess. You really are a mess. You need -- this is my therapy, you know? Well, I'm doing something I have to do, you know? I have to do this or I -- I to do. If I don't get it out, I'll just go crazy. So I got to get it out. Yeah, I do have to get it out or else I'm gonna go crazy. I'll go bananas, 'cause I hold it in. There's so much and it's holding in. I mean, if I'm find -- if you -- XXXX, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. But I have to get the crazy out. I have to get the crazy out.All right, um. I have nothing more to say, so deuces again. Okay, this is the last -- I'm gonna kill the mic, I swear. So I just watched that last bit that I did and I'm saying, yes, bitch. You better be the sexiest mother I know. You better. You better be it, okay? You betta.

"VLOG87","My parents like to constantly remind me that when I grow up I have to marry and Asian wife which is okay. I like Asian women, but I don't like narrowing my options. Girls are like a bag of M and M's, you know, different colors on the outside, but on the inside they're all the same and they all taste good. Hmm, hmm. No one opens a bag of M and M's and goes hey; I'm only eating the yellow ones. You know why? 'Cause that's racist. Hey blue M and M, I don't like your skin tone or your culture or your lifestyle, so I'm not eating you. I only eat yellows. But like most parents, I think the main reason my parents want me to marry an Asian lady is so that we can only have little Asian babies, which I don't agree with. The world needs more interracial babies. I think the only way we can stop racism is to have more interracial babies. You can't be racist to a mixed person. It's too hard. I've tried. Well, you're just mad 'cause you're ah, you're ah, ah -- what the hell are you? No, but my parents really do want me to have Asian babies. I can't even joke around with them. I've tried messing around with my dad, but he takes it very seriously. Okay, so he's sleeping right now. But, I'm gonna to wake him up anyways. Hey dad, wake up, wake up, I have really bad news. I got a girl pregnant. Um it's with a black girl. What!I want to change topics. 'Cause I wanna talk about my dad for a bit, 'cause he's very gullible. So the other day I got this phone. It's called a Junebow , a Junebow It's not your regular phone. It looks like a real cell phone, but all this thing does is it shocks you when you press this middle button right here and I'm not gonna lie, it kinda hurts. So I wanted to record someone's reaction and I thought to myself, who could I use this on and it'd be absolutely hilarious and I was like -- my dad -- definitely.I love my dad. But that's what he gets for not letting me have interracial babies. So, guys and girls, let's start treating each other like Eminem. And that's all I have to say for now. Thanks for watching.Mmm, mmm, mmm, these rolls are so yummy.Just say you love me.No, why you do that?It was an -- it was an accident..","High","High","High"
"VLOG88","Thought you'd never get to see this face again have you. Well, things haven't been that bad and things haven't been that good either. Mm, the bad part is that I have been homeless. The good part is that I got permanent housing, but I might have permanent housing again but in the place that I should of been in and shouldn't of been homeless. But, things are looking up in one way, but still haven't gone the way they should have gone.And because of the economy and things are changing, but you know what's going on out there just as well as I do. So, this is just a first of some of the videos that I can put out right now, um, because I got some of my stuff, so I can post this too you. I still got the same old set up, 'cause money's been tight, just like I know you have not had the money. But, been getting some new people subscribing, so here is the first of a couple of videos, I'm going to do this week. And, I'm going to rant and rave, uh, just fluff, just like I used to and just go, woah.Just like I looked good then I still look good, but the medication has changed somewhat for the better, but not good enough for me. So as far as work, they still haven't written anything consisive [sic. ] and I am still waiting on Social Security, 'cause right now they are just testing, testing, testing. And, I can't change doctors, 'cause I don't have the money. And hopefully congress can do something.I can't ask for Obama to do more that he's put out in a radio address, because it's not his -- it's his final decision, but it is still up to congress. And it's been their decision for the last ten years and they've just been sitting with their thumb up their butt waiting on the insurance companies. And, it's been their decision to tell us what to do when we're being giving them money and they've been going to the bank every day with our money. And, the only thing that we can do is just sit there and take it and we shouldn't be taking it. Same with the doctors, if we don't like the way the medication feels, don't take it. Sometimes you do have to live with the pain and I've been trying to do that for about the last two and a-half, almost three years. So, you're going to get here more bitching about pain and how I feel. So, that's the way it's going to be for me for a bit. But, other than that, this is the first of a few videos, just to tell you that I'm still here, so peace.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG89","﻿Hello, everyone. It is Wednesday, December second and this is your five video. Hope all of you had a really good Thanksgiving. Um, I didn't see any recent videos, so I'm assuming it was good.But I know mine was awesome. I'm sorry I didn't post last week. It's just, Wednesday was my travel day and I was pretty much gone from eight in the morning until I landed at Minneapolis at seven at night. So, I mean it was a long day of planes and trains, automobiles, but other than that, my break was great.I got to see all of my friends and hung out with my family and um, I saved one hundred and twenty dollars on the first four seasons of House, so I mean, Black Friday well spent in my opinion. But uh, it went really fast and -- although it was really good to be home, it was definitely kind of just like oh, it was like, you know, like the carrot dangling in front of me. But I'll be back in less than three weeks anyway. I think I fly home on the nineteenth or whatever, so now it's kind of just the final push through finals, half final push uh, but um, yeah I don't know. It's going to be good.I have, let's see, well I have a paper for my two level class and I have a paper for my Brit Lit class and I have a Latin final final, but that should be fine and then I have a portfolio to finish for my writing class. And so, it's just going to be a lot of writing and I like that, but at the same time I'm kinda just like, aww, we have Beatles rock band in the house now, and that's what I'd rather be doing. Actually, we're doing that tonight, we're having a Beatles rock band party. So, you know I'm being productive.But, I don't know, it's just it's my favorite time of year and I'm in an ugly sweater today in honor of December second and its chilliness and the fact that it's December and I really want a candy cane. Um, yeah, but I -- I don't know.I just am like, like, basically the last three months of the year are when I'm in my element, like I just love them and it's the best. So I'm really excited and I'm excited to be home and I'm excited to go to England, and just, I'm really excited.I don't think I told you guys, but a few weeks ago Hank Green came to Seattle and I flipped out and was so excited to go, until I realized that his, like CD signing thing was the same night as my roommate's musical theater performance, which I had promised months before to go to. So, once again, I did not get to meet the Greens.My friend Ari was nice enough to get a CD signed for me, so now I have a little Hank Green CD with an Anglofish on it and my name and it's one of my prized possessions and so hopefully, in the near future I'll actually get to meet them for real.I've been like knitting this scarf for my boyfriend for a while, but it doesn't really seem to be getting anywhere and I just want to finish this ball of yarn, like, before the holidays begin, so I'm just -- I don't -- I don't know. I have no idea what to do and I have no money and I'm just like, blah. But um, once, once December eighteenth is over, my life will be awesome, so, you know, sixteen more days of hell, yeah.I hope all is well, I have to go tutor now, but I will see you guys next week.","High","High","High"
"VLOG9","﻿Hey guys, it's Monday. Have you ever recorded an entire video only to discover that for some reason or another you don't have the footage that you just took? Well, that just happened to me and I can tell you that it is like the most frustrating feeling in the world. Actually, probably not, but it's really frustrating. Yeah. It makes me really angry. I don't even want to think about how long it has been since we have posted a video on this channel, but I am very happy to be back and I should be looking at the square. I'm looking at the square.So I hope you had a good first day or first week of school. I started school today. I'm usually excited for it to start but this -- this year, I just felt like this summer went by so fast. English, history and drama should be okay. English is my favorite subject so it's really hard for me to dislike my English class. And I'm taking French two, Chemistry, Study Hall, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah -- help. It's boring. So that is that. The information we got in English class says, you cannot hide in this class. Ha, ha, ha. Summer reading -- we had to read three books. We read The Devil in the White City, which was sort of not a political but like a, um, murder mystery type biography ish historical thing. I told you before I suck at book summer reads. People are like what's the book about and I'm like, nuh -- especially explaining stuff like Harry Potter. I just always sound so stupid. The Color Purple Witch I actually enjoyed a lot. The Sun Also Rises, which all I have to say about this book, is that it's awful. And if you have a choice, don't read it. Oh, do you want to see something really scary? Monstrous Elements of a Literature book. And it's huge. And gigantaur . Blah.Oh. Here's a picture of me and a giant lizard of the zoo. Stop shaking. Stop. Mmhhmm. So I've talked about school and the first day first, so I could, like, have the second part of this video be actually happy and talk about summer.I had a really great summer. It was too short because, um, the only part of the summer that I actually enjoyed was July because June was like super boring, because I was just stuck here. I went to Fairhope to visit my grandmother for the fourth of July and then I drove back with Katie to Montgomery. For two weeks, I was a counselor at Camp Shakespeare. I've been a counselor for three years now. Um, I was a camper for four. This is the first year that I've actually bonded with, um, all the other counselors and I miss it a lot, and we did not get to spend enough time together. Between being a counselor and then going to the teen camp, I made a bunch of new friends as well as, um, getting to spend time with the friends I already had, who I love. And I miss everyone so much. And next summer, I hope I can be with you guys even longer.Teen camp was great. It was a week and we did Othello, and one of the first things that our acting teaching said to us was, you may notice that there are no African American children here. So, it will be a learning experience. And it was. We had some girls playing Othello because it was all split up so, there were like several of each character so everyone had a chance because there were a lot of people. But we had girls playing Othello. I was one of the Cassios, so I didn't really like bitchy, yeah, like I was one of the Cassios, yeah. Yes. My summer was very good and I am sad that I am back and going to school. Pppffff, it's kind of a bummer.This has been a boring blog and I'm sorry, but I am glad that the pseudo Canadians are back. I don't have any questions to answer, because we haven't been doing this project for a while and we're just sort of starting afresh. But Russell, I would like to know some of the stuff you said in your thing that you did over the summer, okay? The American Dream definition because that's what our English class this year is going to be about. It's American lit so it's going to be about the, um, American experience, our teacher said. I keep fooling with my hair 'cause I remember that you posted up all this and that was like ha, ha, my definition is really sarcastic, and then you put that quote by George Carlin that says, it's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it. So yes, please summarize or read part of what you said 'cause I would like to know it.My question for you guys is what was your favorite part of this summer? Um yeah, so that's about it. Tell me your favorite part of the summer and put stuff on your head.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG90","Ladies and gentleman, robots. This blog is lastly in response to an article posted on facebook. com about a toddler sized robot that has learning capabilities that within two years will be similar to that of a two year old child. The link is in the sidebar.This robot was designed to learn just like a human. It looks like a human, kinda; it talks like a human, kinda; and apparently it can even walk like a human. A quote from the article, which the company that built the robot might consider as promotional material is, it's not human, but it is paying attention, or maybe not.This article doesn't just deal with this creepy two year old robochild folk, it also talks about the use of robots in modern society. A few of the uses that it cites for robots are a talking office receptionist, a security guard, a primary school teacher. These are all examples of robots that have actually been built and used. A primary school teacher? Really? There are robots that can strut catwalks and assist elderly people who are living alone.Now the first thing I have to ask, in a global recession, when there are so many more jobs needed than have been in recent history, do we really want to be thinking about replacing human workforce with cold mechanical machines? The article does close with a paragraph that might explain my reaction to it -﻿The transfiguring metallic assassins from the future aside, there's something that unnerves me about an old man alone in a house with something that runs on batteries.","High","High","High"
"VLOG91","﻿Hey guys, this is XXXX, coming to you from the XXXX channel on YouTube. Now today, I just wanted to discuss with you the three main operating systems that people use.Okay, the main reason I'm doing this video is to try to use Sony Vegas which I barely got. It's pretty confusing, but so are girls, so whatever. But yeah, so I basically asked people what their favorite operating system was and I got a quite a few responses on Twitter, but I chose three that popped out to me and that is from Yadda yadda . He says, I'm a PC that wishes I'm a Mac. Lags way too much, but that may be a RAM problem. Yeah, I've heard a lot about um -- I can tell -- I can tell you from personal experience that Vista takes up a lot of RAM. I mean, they say that it needs minimum two gigabytes of RAM to operate, but it really takes up like, three to four, which sucks.Um, and the person that sent me a response was Nixypic -﻿I thought that was a pretty funny response, so that's why I included that. And um, Jimmy Tryon on Twitter writes, um, that he uses Windows and Linux.I use Mac for doing video and audio production, and, you know, we've seen in recent years that Macs have pretty much become the standard for video and audio production.So now I'm posing the question to you, the viewer. What do you like to use personally? Windows, Macs, maybe Linux? Tell me.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG92","﻿Hey, everybody. So before you immediately decide to write a hater comment and tell me how much I suck, listen to me, because I do have an actual point. It's not just 'cause I listen to her and I don't like her. I don't hate Taylor Swift as a person. Um, I think she's pretty. I think she should be a model; uh, she's tall and she's thin and she's gorgeous. Um, she seems like a nice person. I just really dislike her songs a lot.And let me tell you why, 'cause it's actually pretty funny. I don't know how many people have noticed this, but a lot of people who are kind of into music, I guess, or have a keen ear, doesn't even -- you don't even have to be into music -- can notice that people use the same pord -- pord progression -- chord progression in every song. And chord progressions are basically, um, the order in which you do the chords; you know, C, D, F minor; I don't know; name any four.Um, most notably, a band -- it's like, this is Nickelback, you know. If you listen to their songs closely, it's just dun dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun, in every song, basically, the way the chords go. Anyway, so to prove a point to my best friend Maria, who is absolutely obsessed with Taylor Swift, um, I transposed all of Taylor Swift's songs into the key of C, which basically means I've got all of her songs, all the chords; I put them so they sound -- they're in the same range, basically. And although the chords are different in the songs, when you put them in the same key, they are literally all the same. Literally, basically, almost the same. They use the same four chords in every song. This is Taylor Swift I'm talking about. They use C, G, A minor and F, in every song, if you put it in the same key.And to prove to you how similar they are, I'm just going to play all of her songs in succession so people can see what I'm talking about. 'Cause I'm not just stupid when I say that all of her songs sound the same. And not only musically do they sound the same. Lyrically, they are all about guys. They 're all about guys. I'm a teenager, with raging hormones; I'm a girl; I like cute, romantic movies, okay. I, whatever, fairytales -- Sleeping Beau -- I don't care, okay. I am not this boy crazy. Just throwing it out there.This is C, this is G, A minor, and F. Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting all we have to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story, baby; just say yes. It's kind of off, but that's how the song goes, basically. I might get some of them wrong; I apologize.Here's a reason for the tear drops on my guitar. The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star. Here's the songs that I sing and I don't know why I do. That's basically her two most popular songs right there. At least I know them. But there's more. If you can see that I'm the one that understands you, been here all along, so why can't you see you belong with me? You belong with me.So, yeah. 'Cause I can't -- I can't help it if you look like an angel. I can't help it if I want to kiss you in the rain, so come feel this magic I been feeling since I met you, can't help it if there is no one else. And that's how the song goes. That's Hey Stephen, the same four chords.Now I'm going to use the same four chords, but it's going to be in a slightly different progression. It's going to be C, A minor, F, D. And when you think Tim McGraw, I hope you think my favorite song, the one we dance to all night long, and the moon like a spotlight on the lake, and when you think happiness, hope you think of my little black -- black dress, think of my head on your chest and this faded blue jeans. I think it goes that way.There's no tune and it goes exactly in this progression. I just wanted to slam your screen door, sneaking out late, tapping on your window. When you're on the phone and you talk real slow, 'cause it's late and your mama don't know. I'm not finishing that, because it would have required me to write down the lyrics and I didn't really feel like writing them, so one more. I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive; you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying; so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time; as far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn.And that's what's up. And that's why I hate Taylor Swift's songs.","High","High","High"

"VLOG94","﻿This is a response to XXXX. Um, okay, so the first question, would you kill a butterfly for a week's paid vacation. No, I wouldn't be able to do it. I just wouldn't be able to do it. I don't know like, stepping on a butterfly, I might -- but I couldn't like, take a butterfly and like, pull its wings off, like that's just sadistic and not right. I wouldn't be able to do it, even for a month's vacation, I wouldn't be able to do it.Um, would you add one year of your life for taking someone else's? No, I wouldn't be able to do that either because, you know -- like, I don't want to die, but I don't want to be responsible for someone else dying too. You know, like, taking years off another life so I can live another year -- what's good about me that makes me -- like -- able to take someone else's and be okay with it; I wouldn't be able to do it. So that's a no. Would you urinate with someone else? I've done it before. Um, I'm a girl so we go to the bathroom in groups. So, yes, I could do it, whatever right, so long as they don't make any comments about hearing it so easily, but, yeah, I'm okay with it, it's fine, whatever, right.Are you going to ask me. I'm very good about that actually. I enjoy getting coupled, because I don't like doing things on my own. Like cooking, I'll do on my own, but I like having someone there you know you can talk to and later on you can go or whatever. You know I don't like working by myself because it gets very lonely. You know when there are lots of people answering, it gets very lonely, because you know you can't really talk to your customers about like, other things -- and you're not really friends with them so it gets very lonely.Uh, if there was a public execution, would you watch? No. I really wouldn't; I don't want to watch someone die. I don't care; I don't care how bad they were; I don't care who would want to watch? Okay, yeah, someone's getting executed. You know, I don't want to watch somebody die. I don't watch The Simpsons, but I'd rather watch The Simpsons than watch an execution. Um, so, I apologize for the dark circles.I'm logging off; I'm extremely tired.","Low","High","High"

"VLOG97","﻿It's really difficult doing this particular part of a blog where I am trying to talk about the economic crisis and me and, um, my story. I have recorded this a number of times. Um, I stumble over myself, and so, here we go again. Um, you know, when it comes to the economy and me and my story, you know, I don't think mine is really a whole lot different than millions of other people, because really and truly this current economic crisis, which, you know, we kind of recognize began, um, two thousand and seven, um, started for many of us though, really about ten years ago, with the tech telecom crash.Um, so in my case it actually was the year two thousand when I lost a twenty eight year career. Um, and it was without any buyouts, uh, pension, any benefits or anything like that. It was just, uh --'cause not everyone got all of those kinds of things, which I think is a huge misunderstanding across this country that, uh, you know -- there is a huge sort of have and have not of a group of people when they do, uh, leave companies. So, uh, I managed to sort of, kind of, gather myself together and regroup from then, and it was, you know -- it was not, uh, totally unexpected, and I continued on. But the thing was that, you know, what, uh, that didn't -- didn't -- that didn't do to me, um, was changed on September eleventh, two thousand and one, when, uh, that event affected my partner, uh, financially. So there was kind of a double wammy there. And we were still doing quite well. I cannot say that, uh, things were bad for us. Uh, we definitely had taken some financial hits on, you know, retirements and things like that.So we quickly knew and had to start changing our thinking on the way that we lived and how that we spent money. And, uh, neither one of us really have ever been, uh, in debt or, uh, use debt much. Um, so, um, cost cutting, things like that, which in a lot of ways, honestly, was inherently in our nature. Um, it just seemed kind of crazy though because, uh, we were working as hard as we ever were, um, in fact, even more so, and, uh, we were making, you know, decent money -- not great money. And I know that, uh, we knew that people that were around us were making about the same money, but somehow they seemed to be doing so much better with a lot of the material, consumer goods and all that kind of stuff, and, uh -And so that was a very interesting awakening, uh, in the consciousness about, you know, how Americans are, and how we have become the country consumers. And you know we just begin to learn to live, sort of, with that, and not be a part of it, I suppose.Um, however, that doesn't mean that this last economic crisis, uh, in two thousand and seven didn't impact us, uh, me in particular, particularly hard, because, um, I've been lost, uh, the second, uh, job that I had -- uh, had for a long time. And, um, you know, it's been difficult, uh, more -- but we were fairly well prepared for all of that stuff and have been holding our own, keeping our head above water, and, um, that's still the way it is now. But this cannot go on. So it really is all about, um, continuing to look for those multiple streams of income that you know are small, but you know they do contribute to things. Um, and, um, looking at the whole way of, uh, employment and income and jobs entirely differently, um, and approaching it from a whole different way in -- so that -- in order to be able to accept that there is a new world. This is a new way of doing things. It's not going back to the way they were, even if there is a recession technically called over.The rebuilding period is going to be a very different thing for so many of us. Um, and it is really about how we adapt to that. And it's fluid. It's ever evolving. It's constantly changing, and that's the key thing, is knowing that it's shifting ground and that we are operating on shifting ground, and if we can keep that in mind and still keep our heads together, we've got at least some chance.","Low","Low","High"
"VLOG98","﻿Hi, everybody. I don't have my glasses on. Um, where are my glasses? Oh my God, in the middle of getting wetty. Wetty. . I was trying to upload another happy video and it was like such a big file, so I'm like, I have, ah, something else. Other things made me happy today. It's super early in my day, so you guys can do this at the end of the day if you want to wait. I'm begging for the picture replies on DailyBooth link on the side. If you don't have a video camera and you want to do, um, just picture replies and things that may, oh my God, Colin is making me happy today.Um, but the three things -- I already have three things in my head that are making me happy today. Number one is this sweater. A lot of you always pick clothes and I think it's cool to have, you know, if you have a pair of jeans on, or a sweat -- this is a fall sweater; truly a fall sweater. So, I love this sweater. I haven't worn this all year, so I'm wearing this today, and it's making me happy. I'm like, yeah, fall sweater. Guys, now knock it off. Um, so I love my sweater; that's one.Two, I just finished Ally McBeal Season Four last night -- when Larry leaves. He's gonna -- Larry left. He's gonna leave a note. She kept saying that. He's gonna leave a note. So I love Ally McBeal. And now I know Season Five isn't very good, but tonight I'm ready to watch Season Five on DVD with all of the new characters. Whatever.I realize that a lot of TV shows that I've enjoyed over the years, like Glee, and Ally McBeal, have a musical component. You know, I just -- I love the musical aspect of Ally McBeal. Um, so that's two things. I'm very excited. I -- I -- you know, every night -- it's joy watching -- but you might hear this every day; I might mention TV and what joy TV brings me every day, but Ally McBeal brings me joy on DVD every day. Um, why? They're all -- they're all yelling at me.And number three, I'm going to meet Gary today -- Gary Vaynerchuk -- who's, uh, book is out, Crush It! And he's doing a book signing and he's actually doing it at my former place of employment. Isn't that funny? So I'm going back to my old stomping grounds where I used to work. And he will be there. And I'm going to have him sign my books.Stop that! Um, I dunno why they're --knock it off! I'm sorry, they're -- I -- I don't-- I'm sorry; I'm not really a yeller, but I -- I -- it's just -- it's a habit because I'll be doing What the Buck, and I'll hear them and I'll be like, shut up. And I know that's -- that's rude but, they're dogs. I love you with all my heart. Elie's in the chair.Um, so any -- anyway I can't weet to mate -- whoop, I can't meet to wait -- I can't wait to meet Gary today. I'm super excited. Um, anyways. Elie, Elie can you say hi? She thinks she's a person. Do you see her? She sits on the chair, sitting next to me. Don't you remember you told me you love me baby? She's very special. Um, so what made you guys happy today? Leave a comment, make a video reply, make a photo reply, and, um, this is a fun way to blog my What the Buck show, which is an interview with Carey Perseen , will be up soon. Happiness. It's so easy. Be happy every day. Find things to be happy about.","High","High","Low"
"VLOG99","﻿Guess who's procrastinating? I am. There's a really loud airplane. I kind of haven't been here, I'm sorry about that. I've had exams last week and I have another -- another one this week and the which is a three hour exam for -- I don't know why, and I think it's a total waste of time, but we'll see how that goes. And if you've got exams as well, good luck, hope you're doing well.Um, I don't know why I point over my shoulder when I say last week and this week. Anyway, um, and after this video I probably won't be here for the next month, because I have my final killer exam ever and I've kind of been neglecting piano because of school exams and I kind of burnt my hand yesterday, because, um, I was serving soup. I'll explain this later. I was serving soup and my dad walked into me and then the soup fell and I just, like, dropped the bowl and ran off and stuck it under cold water. But my dad called me weak for the next two hours just because he refused to admit that it was his fault, so then he's was like shhhh, you can't handle pain. I was like, yeah, it was your fault, God. Um, but yes, I was serving soup because my grandma's cousin's son and daughter are here. Um, I think they're my second cousins once removed because they're my dad's generation. Um, so if somebody understands family trees, would they care to explain to me who they are to me because they -- they are related to me, you know. If you're Asian, I mean, everybody's related to you.Sorry to butt in. I found out after they left that they're actually my grandma's cousins, not my grandma's cousin's kids. They're just the same age as my dad. My dad calls them uncle and auntie. I've been calling them great uncle and auntie the entire time. It's just I didn't know because my mom sort of tells me to say whatever in a foreign language. I could have been calling them streetlamp -- I wouldn't know. Um, I actually called their kids uncle and auntie, and their kids are like twelve or something, so, well I guess if you want to get technical, they're not -- they're my cousins. Okay, not going to get technical, but the good thing about when people come over -- they give you gifts. I got a hundred bucks and a really expensive necklace and trust me to be, you know, more in love with the packaging, because how cool is this? Two colors. I think it's cool with the ribbons and the thing, yeah. I usually disregard the gift and go for the wrappings, so, yep.Um, and because I have just been procrastinating for the past like, three hours, um, I picked up this mascara because my mom always buys -- she always orders stuff and it comes with free gift things and she just gives them all to me. I was reading this and it goes, in case of an eye irritation, discontinue use and see your ophthalmologist at once, because everybody has an ophthalmologist, you know. They assume that people who buy high class stuff have ophthalmologists. I assume that's some kind of eye doctor, but really why don't -- go see a doctor. It's not like you can get into a specialist person without a doctor referral anyway.Yes. And other than that I think I should go back to studying and I think I have to catch the bus pretty soon anyway, um, 'cause my parents have left me at home and taken out my -- my second cousin, once removed, to Red Hill, the winery, and then they were going to go eat dinner at night time. Sorry, did I say eat dinner at night time? I think I meant eat dinner in the morning because when else do you eat dinner? Because, you know, if you're Asian, you go eat dinner when people come over.It's me again, the less cool version of me in a grey jumper. She's also quite uncool. Okay, I was saying I burnt myself on soup. The next day I burnt myself on coffee because I was out. I went to Gloria Jean's and bought myself a small caramel latte, four dollars and five cents. Definitely didn't put the lid on properly, um, because the coffee ended up everywhere except for where it should have ended up, in my tummy. Um, I was in public, so I tried to run away as inconspicuously and quickly as I could, but it didn't go down so well because it was on the floor. It was all over me, um, and I burnt my thumb.And then today, don't -- don't ever try and staple about a hundred pages together at once, it doesn't work. Um, I -- 'cause we're allowed to bring in notes for our exams and I had to staple this together. I stapled them into three chunks and then I stapled the chunks together, and it looked a bit, you know, like this. It's quite graceful looking. Um, and then I was trying to do that thing where you try and get as many papers together as possible without snapping a staple and that was the result. Um, and I guess before the exam, I was holding it like this, with my finger over it, and I guess I decided to move really fast and then I ripped a hole in my finger. So yeah, just don't try and staple things especially if you're me, um, which none of you are.So that's my list of injuries for this week. I will see how many times I run my finger through a staple in the rest of my life. I'll keep you updated.","Low","Low","High"
